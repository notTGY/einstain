# [Lorenz attractor](https://nottgy.github.io/einstain/lorenzAttractor)

This is a demo of strange Lorenz Attractor.
This stuff simulates fluid dynamics or something...
It was intended for my use in studying, but turned out pretty cool exercise for programming path.
You can get more info about Lorenz Attractor in wikipedia.
