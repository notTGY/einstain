#[skateboarding](https://nottgy.github.io/einstain/skateboarding/skateboarding.html)

This is my second big project. This is a game about skateboarding ;)

So, this stuff is quite cool, cause I made this game crossplatform.
You can play it ( :OMG: ). But I wouldn't recommend you, this was my early experience.
Because of it game is written very poorly and a lot of bugs were introduced.
However, you can still checkout some pretty animations I did without knowing 3d stuff at all.

This game is also made modular from the perspective you can change the track you riding.
But it still requires to edit source code.

Another pretty ~~~middle project
