    <h2 id="opening">Why I started this</h2>
    <p class="highlight">
      So, Idea for this website came to me from a dialog.
      Here is what I was told.
      Check this out, this is incredible:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span>
      We have looked up your previous websites and haven't
      seen <strong>any</strong> fancy CSS going there.
      We think <em>you don't have talent</em>
      in styling a webpage.
      <span>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="highlight">
      To be honest, I was so shocked...
      I didn't answer anything, so buzzed off I was.
      Later this perfect answer came to my head:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="epic">I can do everything.</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Beutiful and genious, how simple it is.
      At least I'm being jackass not thinking so fast
      to <em>"return message to the sender"</em>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="main-part">Why my projects seem to lack CSS</h2>
    <p>
      From the start of my learning path till now
      I had this clear idea of what I want my works
      to look like. And design was not the main goal.
      Basically, I firstly want to make something that
      works and actually does meaningful things, not
      postcard sites.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's why I spent most of my time coding some
      amazing ideas into life. I rushed from project
      to project in order to complete more templates
      for myself to find an idea, that would hook me
      the most. To implement <strong>something actually useful</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ending">What I think about it</h2>
    <p>
      Recently I started doing
      <a href="https://cssbattle.dev/">
        cssbattle.dev
      </a>.
      I don't know how well related it is to real CSS
      you write in production, but some things are real
      beautiful and challenging to design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I guess, I am bad at CSS, cause I can't
      make such a langing page that it feels surreal.
      However, in the end, your customer rarely will
      want you to build him new
      <a href="https://stripe.com/">stripe</a>.
      So I would still take <em>"You are bad at CSS</em>
      as a threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just in case you want to say this to me, please,
      think beforehand if you really want :)
    </p>
    <p>
      So I am not angry. I made this website just
      to prove that I know some CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, I said, please, I don't want any conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just saying that I know a little of CSS,
      not insisting. You can go with your opinion,
      if you want.
