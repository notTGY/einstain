# [Simple Music System](https://nottgy.github.io/einstain/SiMuS/index.html)

This is pretty cool idea of mine.
This tool helps to generate WebAudio API music.
It is also quite an improvement of a design level (made it after ~3 months of js).
From the UX point of view, this is like amazing)) you can drag things around with a mouse, click to add stuff.
You can also use keyboard shortcuts and this is fully non-mouse compatible thing.
Anyways, this is not a rocket science - just learning project.
Also, this thing taught me "embedded js" things (I created export module, which can be plugged into working js
program and played easily)
