        <h1>Brainf*ck programming language</h1>
        <p>Yeah, you are right , there is language named like this. Because it has pretty minimal
            default commands. This f*cks your brain!
        </p>

        <p>
            Spoiler: this language was not created by me - this is just my javascript implementation
        </p>

        <p>
            Brainf*ck architecture is quite similar to Turing machine with half-long tape.
            You basically can move to next byte ">" , move to previous byte "<" and perform other operations with tape and i/o.
            By default each byte is equal to 0.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are total of 8 operations (I went over 2 already):
            <ul>
                <li>"+" increments byte you are pointing at by 1</li>
                <li>"-" decrements byte you are pointing at by 1</li>
                <li>"." writes byte you are pointing at as UTF-8 char (for example 48 will write "0")</li>
                <li>"," reads char in the same fashion way</li>
                <li>"[" is equal to "while(stack[index]!=0){"</li>
                <li>"]"is equal to "}"</li>
            </ul>
            Very funny, but this is real language and you can perform every finite-state calculations (maybe you would like to hack Enigma :) )
        </p>
        <p>
            If you try to look up it somewhere you will be able to see this example for testing and getting started. "Hello World!" in BF way:
