        <p>
            This is pretty thick - Turing complete cellular automaton!
        </p>

        <p>
            For real! This is just limited area of cells, which have two states: alive and dead.
            When you play this "Game" you can (by left-clicking) make any cell change it`s state.
            By right-clicking you will start game (also pause it once started) and you will see some things happening according to the rules.
        </p>

        <h3>Rules are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If cell has more than 3 alive neighbours it becomes dead</li>
            <li>If cell has less than 2 alive neighbours it becomes dead</li>
            <li>If cell has exactly 3 alive neighbours it becomes alive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Pretty straight-forward, right? But you can create things with endless possibilities inside of this.
        </p>

        <p>
            For getting around you can use WASD or Arrows. To zoom in and out use + and -. To speed up time or slow it down use > or <.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, try out this example :  3 cells in row, cross out of 5 cells.
