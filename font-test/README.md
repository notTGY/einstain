# font test
is a prototype of my other project [bujo](https://github.com/notTGY/bujo-web).
Basically it consists of two parts:
* [font testing stuff](https://nottgy.github.io/einstain/font-test/book.html)
* [picture painting testing stuff](https://nottgy.github.io/einstain/font-test/painting.html)

While font testing stuff is pretty boring, picture painting widget is quite cool.

On font testing stuff you can see disabled icon jump around the grid as you click the page.
This is the demonstraion of grid coordinates transformation.

On painting stuff you can try to actually paint something.

To sum up, both of those experiments turned out very beautiful, so I have rewritten them in React.
