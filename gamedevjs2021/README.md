This is a shitty game (graphics are pretty good though).
As this is pretty recent project, this is quite well made, however I may change my opinion on it.
About game: 
You control a cube, that flies down, when you don't touch anything (mouse, keyboard), and
flies up when you, say click.
You can pick up portal to jump to the other side of the mirror, collect coins and you have to dodge both 
real objects and over-mirror things.

In the end I didn't submit it to the [gamedevjs2021](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2021)
due to me thinking it is not worthy game (try to beat this XD).
