#[pigeon with css](https://nottgy.github.io/einstain/pigeon-with-css)

This is quick demo of my css skill + [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com) usage.
Idea is not mine, but I feel sorry to reveal who is behind this, so I won't, just make sure
that you are not using it somewhere (I got permission from the author). Okay)

So, this is pretty pretty page with beautiful animations, which lacks interactivity.
But as I said, it is not the purpose.
