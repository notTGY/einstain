it feels like a perfect night
to dress up like hipsters
and make fun of our exes
uh$uh, uh$uh
it feels like a perfect night
for breakfast at midnight
to fall in love with strangers
uh$uh, uh$uh


yeah
we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
it's miserable and magical, oh yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines

i don't know about you
but i'm feelin' twenty$two
everything will be alright if
you keep me next to you
you don't know about me

it seems like one of those nights
this place is too crowded
too many cool kids
uh$uh, uh$uh $who's taylor swift anyway$ ew$
it seems like one of those nights
we ditch the whole scene
and end up dreamin'
instead of sleepin'


yeah
we're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
it's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
it's time, oh$oh


$hey$

but i'm feelin' twenty$two

it feels like one of those nights

you look like bad news
i gotta have you

ooh, oh

it feels like one of those nights $twenty$two$
we ditch the whole scene
it feels like one of those nights $twenty$two$
we won't be sleepin'
it feels like one of those nights $twenty$two$
you look like bad news
i gotta have you
i gotta have you~i walked through the door with you, the air was cold
but somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer, even now


oh, your sweet disposition and my wide$eyed gaze
we're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days


and i know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
oh, oh, oh


'caus$ there we ar$ again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well


photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin$sized bed
and your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee$ball team
you taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
and you were tossing me the car keys, $fuck the patriarchy$
keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
and i was thinkin' on the drive down, $any time now
he's gonna say it's love,$ you never called it what it was
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you
but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame


and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to


'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret, but i kept you like an oath
sacred prayer and we'd swear
to remember it all too well, yeah


well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
runnin' scared, i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
i'm a crumpled$up piece of paper lyin' here
'cause i remember it all, all, all

they say all's well that ends well, but i'm in a new hell
every time you double$cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me, who was she$
a never$needy, ever$lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weepin' in a party bathroom
some actress askin' me what happened, you
that's what happened, you
you who charmed my dad with self$effacing jokes
sippin' coffee like you're on a late$night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
and he said, $it's supposed to be fun turning twenty$one$


time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still tryin' to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well
wind in my hair, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well

and i was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
$i'll get older, but your lovers stay my age$
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones
i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue$
just between us, did the love affair maim you too$
'cause in this city's barren cold
i still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell
i remember it all too well


just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well$
just between us, do you remember it all too well$
just between us, i remember it $just between us$ all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there $i was there$
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there $oh$
down the stairs, i was there, i was there $i was there$
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it $all too well$
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it~i walked through the door with you, the air was cold

i remember it all too well~what about your promises, promises$
what about your promises, promises, promises$ no


what a shame
didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
that you never should have made


i'm here on the kitchen floor
you call, but i won't hear it
you said, $no one else$
how could you do this, babe$


$what about your promises, promises$$
you really blew this, babe
we ain't getting through this one, babe
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe
$this is the last time, this is the last time$
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe
$what about your promises, promises, promises$ no$


what a waste
takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
and it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe


i break down every time you call
we're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
we said, $no one else$
how could you do this, babe$


$oh, what about your promises, promises$$
you really blew this, babe
we ain't getting through this one, babe
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe
$this is the last time, this is the last time$
this is the last time i'll ever call you


since you admitted it $oh$oh$, i keep picturin' $oh$oh$
her lips on your neck $oh$oh$, i can't unsee it
i hate that because of you, i can't love you, babe
what a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
how could you do this, babe$ $babe$


you really blew this, babe $babe$
we ain't getting through this one, babe $babe$
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe $babe$
$this is the last time, this is the last time$
this is the last time i'll ever call you

i'm here on the kitchen floor
you call, but i won't hear it
you said, $no one else$
we ain't getting through this one, babe
i break down every time you call
we're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
we said, $no one else$
this is the last time i'll ever call you, babe $babe$
$what about your promises, promises$$~took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn't like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didn't get this song
but i do, i do


i walked in, expecting you'd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you don't know how nice that is
but i do


and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
but on a w$dnesday in a caf$, i watched it begin again


you said you n$ver met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you don't know why
i'm coming off a little shy
but i do


but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
but on a wednesday in a caf$, i watched it begin again




and we walked down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches every single christmas
and i want to talk about that
and for the first time, what's past is past


'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
but on a wednesday in a caf$, i watched it begin again


on a wednesday in a caf$, i watched it begin again~i know i'm probably better off on my own
than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
and i see the permanent damage you did to me
never again, i just wish i could forget when it was magic


i wish it wasn't $am, standin' in the mirror
saying to myself, $you know you had to do it$
i know the bravest thing i ever did was run


sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man


i know i'm probably better off all alone
than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
and it was always on your terms, i waited on every careless word
hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning


but your jealousy, oh, i can hear it now
talking down to me like i'd always be around
push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
oh, you never thought i'd run


sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man


i hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all i have
and i gave to you my best
and we both know you can't say that


i wish you were a better man
i wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
we might still be in love if you were a better man
you would've been the one if you were a better man


sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
$sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again$
we might still be in love, if you were a better man
$but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man$
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man

we might still be in love if you were a better man
you would've been the one if you were a better man~you said it in a simple way
$ a$m$, the second day
how strange that i don't know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss, then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall


i told myself, $don't get attached$
but in my mind, i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you


and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here


the delicate beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never would've played so nonchalant


taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i can't help but wish you took me with you


and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in london today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here


oh, oh
oh, oh
oh, oh


this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you when you are worlds away


in new york, be here
but you're in london, and i break down
'cause it's not fair that you're not around

this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here


oh, oh, i don't wanna miss you like this
oh, oh


come back, be here
come back, be here~you good to go$


all i knew this morning when i woke
is i know something now
know something now i didn't before
and all i've seen since eighteen hours ago
is green eyes and freckles and your smile
in the back of my mind, making me feel like


i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you
know you, know you


'cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming hom$
all i know is a simple name
everything has chang$d
all i know is you held the door
you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed


and all my walls stood tall, painted blue
but i'll take 'em down, take 'em down
and open up the door for you
and all i feel in my stomach is butterflies
the beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
takin' flight, making me feel like


i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you
know you, know you


'cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home
all i know is a simple name
everything has changed
all i know is you held the door
you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed

come back and tell me why
i'm feeling like i've missed you all this time
and meet me there tonight
and let me know that it's not all in my mind


i just wanna know you better
know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you
know you, know you


all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home
all i know is a simple name
everything has changed
all i know is you held the door
and you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed


all i know is we said hello
so dust off your highest hopes
all i know is pouring rain
and everything has changed
all i know is a new found grace
all my days, i'll know your face
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed~he says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
he says, $why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away$$
he spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
he spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity


i call, just checkin' up on him
he's up, $am, pacin'
he says, $it's not just a phase i'm in$
my voice comes out beggin'


all this time, i didn't know
you were breakin' down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go


he seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds
his laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
i pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead


i call, just checkin' up on him
he's up, $am, wasted
long gone, not even listening
my voice comes out screamin'


all this time, i didn't know
you were breakin' down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go


if i was standing there in your apartment
i'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
i'd say, $i love you even at your darkest and
please, don't go$


i didn't know
you were breakin' down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go

$ooh, ooh, ooh$
i'll be your summer sun forever
$ooh, ooh, ooh$ at $am, pacin'
all this time, i didn't know
$ooh, ooh, ooh$ at $am, wasted
i'd be in pieces on the floor
forever winter if you go


he says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
i say, $believe in one thing, i won't go away~don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah$ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that


i don't even know her
but i feel a responsibility
to do what's upstanding and right
it's kinda like a code, yeah
and you've been getting closer and closer
and crossing so many lines


and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
but, honey, i am no one's exception
this, i have previously learned


so don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah$ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, $verybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
and now you've got m$ alone, and i say
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that


i just wanna make sure
you understand perfectly
you're the kind of man who makes me sad
while she waits up
you chase down the newest thing
and take for granted what you have


and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
and, yeah, i might go with it
if i hadn't once been just like her


so don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah$ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
and now you've got me alone, and i say
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that


oh$oh
oh$oh

call a cab, lose my number
you're about to lose your girl
call a cab, lose my number
let's consider this lesson learned


don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah$ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that
wanna see you pick up your phone
and tell her you're coming home
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that


it would be a fine proposition
if i hadn't once been just like her~i was reminiscing just the other day
while having coffee all alone and, lord, it took me away
back to a first$glance feeling on new york time
back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light, go
yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
and that was the first day


and darling, it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground


spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big, wide city all to ourselves
w$ block the noise with the sound of $i need you$
and for th$ first time, i had something to lose
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the story's got dust on every page
but, sometimes, i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd


'cause, darling, it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground


tonight, i'm gonna dance
for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
tonight, i'm gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you


it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground


tonight, i'm gonna dance
for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
tonight, i'm gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you~i bet this time of night, you're still up
i bet you're tired from a long hard week
i bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
looking out at the city, and i bet
sometimes you wonder 'bout me


and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do
i almost do


i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
'cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
i bet it never, ever occurred to you
that i can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye


and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do
i almost do


oh, we made quite a mess, babe
it's probably better off this way
and i confess, baby
in my dreams, you're touching my face
and asking me if i wanna try again with you
and i almost do


and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do
i almost do


i bet this time of night, you're still up
i bet you're tired from a long hard week
i bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
looking out at the city, and i hope
sometimes you wonder 'bout me~$ am and i'm still awake, i'll bet you're just fine
fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
and the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
and i'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh


well, i tried to fit in with your upper$crust circles
yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
and the book that just saved 'em that i hadn't heard of


but now that we're done and it's over
i bet you couldn't believe
when you realized i'm harder to forget than i was to leave
and i bet you think about me


you grew up in a silver$spoon gated community
glamorous, shiny, bright beverly hills
i was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills


but you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
and you and i fell like an early spring snow
but reality crept in, you said we're too different
you laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes


mr$ superior thinkin'
do you have all the space that you need$
i don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
and i bet you think about me


i bet you think about me, yes
i bet you think about me


oh, block it all out
the voices so loud, sayin'
$why did you let her go$$
does it make you feel sad
that the love that you're lookin' for
is the love that you had$


now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
scared not to be hip, scared to get old
chasing make$believe status, last time you felt free
was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me


but now that we're done and it's over
i bet it's hard to believe
but it turned out i'm harder to forget than i was to leave
and, yeah, i bet you think about me

i bet you think about me, yes
i bet you think about me


i bet you think about me when you're out
at your cool indie music concerts every week
i bet you think about me in your house
with your organic shoes and your million$dollar couch
i bet you think about me when you say
$oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me$
i bet you think about me~once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights, you got me alone
you found me, you found me
you found me$e$e$e$e
i guess you didn't care and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard, you took a step back
without me, without me
without me$e$e$e$e


and he's long gone when he's next to me
and i realize the blame is on me


'cause i knew you were troubl$ when you walked in
so shame on m$ now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh
trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh
trouble, trouble, trouble


no apologies, he'll never see you cry
pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
you're drowning, you're drowning
you're drowning$ing$ing$ing$ing
and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
and now i see, now i see
now i see$e$e$e$e


he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me, hey


i knew you were trouble when you walked in $oh$

now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh $yeah$
trouble, trouble, trouble $trouble$
oh, oh
trouble, trouble, trouble

and the saddest fear
comes creeping in
that you never loved me or her
or anyone, or anything, yeah


i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been $never been$
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in $knew it right there$
so shame on me now $knew it right there$
flew me to places i'd never been $ooh$
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh
trouble, trouble, trouble $oh$

'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble
'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble~i know that you like me
and it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
and i became hypnotized
by freckles and bright eyes, tongue$tied


but now, you're so far away and i'm down
feelin' like a face in the crowd
i'm reachin' for you, terrified


'cause you could be the one that i love
i could be the one that you dream of
a message in a bottle is all i can do
standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
you could be the one that i keep, and i
i could be the reason you can't sleep at night
a m$ssage in a bottle is all i can do
standin' her$, hopin' it gets to you


these days i'm restless
workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
but time moves faster
replayin' your laughter, disaster


'cause now, you're so far away and i'm down
feelin' like a face in the crowd
i'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause


'cause you could be the one that i love
i could be the one that you dream of
a message in a bottle is all i can do
standin' here, hopin' it gets to you $it gets to you$

$love$ you could be the one that i love
$love$ you could be the one that i love
$love$ my love
and now i'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you~they tell you while you're young
$girls, go out and have your fun$
then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
criticize the way you fly
when you're soaring through the sky
shoot you down and then they sigh
and say, $she looks like she's been through it$


lord, what will become of me
once i've lost my novelty$


i've had too much to drink tonight
and i know it's sad, but this is what i think about
and i wake up in the middle of the night
it's like i can feel time moving
how can a person know everythin' at eighteen
but nothin' at twenty$two$
and will you still want me
when i'm nothing new$

how long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room$
when you can't blame it on my youth
and roll your eyes with affection
and my cheeks are growing tired
from turning red and faking smiles
are we only biding time 'til i lose your attention$


and someone else lights up the room $ah$
people love an ing$nue $ah$


i've had $i've had$ too much to drink tonight
how did i go from growin' up to breaking down$
and i wake up $wake up$ in the middle of the night
it's like i can feel time movin'
how can a person know everything at eighteen
but nothing at twenty$two$
and will you still want me
when i'm nothing new$


i know someday i'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
the kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
she'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
i'll say i'm happy for her, then i'll cry myself to sleep
oh, woah, oh $oh$
oh, woah, oh, woah, oh $oh$


i've had $i've had$ too much to drink tonight
but i wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
i wake up $wake up$ in the middle of the night
and i can feel time moving
how can a person know everything at eighteen
but nothing at twenty$two$
and will you still want me
will you still want me
will you still want me
when i'm nothing new$~loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead$end street
faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone $woah$
forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red $red, red$
$red, red$
but loving him was red $red, red$
$red, red$


touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone $woah$
forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red $red, red$
oh, red $red, red$
burning red $red, red$
$red, red$


remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
burning, it was red


oh, losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone $woah$
forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
'cause loving him was red $red, red$
yeah, yeah, red $red, red$
oh, burning red $red, red$
$red, red$


and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head $red, red$
comes back to me, burning red $red, red$
$red, red$
yeah, yeah $red, red$


his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead$end street~i remember your bare feet down the hallway
i remember your little laugh
race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
i love you to the moon and back
i remember your blue eyes looking into mine
like we had our own secret club
i remember you dancing before bedtime
then jumping on me, waking me up
i can still feel you hold my hand, little man
and even the moment i knew
you fought it hard like an army guy
remember i leaned in and whispered to you


$come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years$


i remember the drive home, when the blind hope
turned to crying and screaming, $why$$
flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
about a beautiful boy who died
and it's about to be halloween, you could be anything
you wanted if you were still here
i remember the last day, when i kissed your face
and whispered in your ear


$come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
we'll just disappear
come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years$


what if i'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you$
and what if i kept the hand$me$downs you won't grow into$
and what if i really thought some miracle would see us through$
what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you$


come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years


i remember your bare feet down the hallway
i love you to the moon and back~one, two, three, four


give me the keys, i'll bring the car back around
we shouldn't be in this town
and my so$called friends, they don't know
i'd drive away before i let you go
so give me a reason and don't say no, no


there's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where i wrote
$i'll wait for you$
there's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
take it with you


and run like you'd run from the law
darling, let's run
run from it all
we can go where our eyes can take us
go where no one else is, run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run


so you laugh like a child
and i'll sing like no one cares
no one to be and no one to tell
i could see this view a hundred times
pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
so give me a reason and don't say no, no


and the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
since i gave it to you
there's a heart on your sleeve, i'll take it when i leave
and hold it for you


and run like you'd run from the law
darling, let's run
run from it all
we can go like they're trying to chase us
go where no one else is, run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run


there's been this hole in my heart
this thing was a shot in the dark
say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
and i'll hold onto you while we run
$and we run and we run and we run$

like you'd run from the law
$and we run and we run and we run$
darling, let's run
$and we run and we run and we run$
run from it all
$and we run and we run and we run$
we can go where our eyes can take us
go where no one else is, run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, we'll run
ooh, and we'll run~long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
i stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


we had a beautiful, magic love there
what a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


in dreams, i meet you in warm conversation
and we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
and time is taking its sweet time erasing you
and you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me


'cause w$ had a beautiful, magic love ther$
what a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


woah, woah


distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
silence, the train runs off its tracks
kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen$
hang up, give up and for the life of us, we can't get back


a beautiful, magic love there
what a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
what we had, a beautiful, magic love there
what a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
we had a beautiful, magic love there
what a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair~i said, $oh my, what a marvelous tune$
it was the best night
never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight
like we're made of starlight


i met bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '$$
picks me up late one night
out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
can't remember what song it was playing wh$n we walked in
the night w$ snuck into a yacht club party
pretending to be a duchess and a prince


and i said, $oh my, what a marvelous tune$
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight


he said, $look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
you'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way$
he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
$don't you see the starlight, starlight$
don't you dream impossible things$$


like, $oh my, what a marvelous tune$
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight


ooh$ooh, he's talking crazy
ooh$ooh, dancing with me
ooh$ooh, we could get married
have ten kids and teach them how to dream


$ooh, hoo, hoo$
$ooh, hoo, hoo$
$ooh, hoo, hoo$
$ooh, hoo, hoo$


oh my, what a marvelous tune
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight

like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
like starlight, starlight
like we dream impossible dreams


don't you see the starlight, starlight$
don't you dream impossible things$~i'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
or fades in time


and i never $never$
saw you comin'
and i'll never $never$
be the same


you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannonball
now all we know is don't let go
we are alone, just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


so you were never a saint and i loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild


and i never $never$
saw you comin'
and i'll never $never$
be the same


this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
you're my achilles heel
this is the golden age
of something good and right and real


and i never $never$
saw you comin'
and i'll never
be the same, oh
and i never $never$
saw you comin'
and i'll never $never$
$so you were never a saint and i loved in shades of wrong$
be the same $we learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts$
$but this love is brave and wild$

this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right~i'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
i threw my phone across the room at you
i was expecting some dramatic turn away
but you stayed
this morning, i said we should talk about it
'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved
that's when you came in wearing a football helmet
and said, $okay, let's talk$


and i said, $stay, stay, stay$
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay


before you, i'd only dated self$indulgent takers
who took all of their problems out on me
but you carry my groceries and now i'm always laughing
and i love you because you have given me


no choice but to stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


you took the time to memorize me
my fears, my hopes and dreams
i just like hanging out with you
all the time
all those times that you didn't leave
it's been occurring to me
i'd like to hang out with you
for my whole life


stay
and i'll be loving you for quite some time
no one else is gonna love me when i get mad, mad, mad
so i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay


that's so fun~i find myself at your door
just like all those times before
i'm not sure how i got there
all roads they lead me here
i imagine you are home
in your room, all alone
and you open your eyes into mine
and everything feels better


and right before your eyes
i'm breaking
no past, no reasons why
just you and me


this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye


you find yourself at my door
and just like all those times before
you wear your best apology
but i was there to watch you leave
and all the times i let you in
just for you to go again
disappear when you come back
everything is better


and right before your eyes
i'm aching
no past, nowhere to hide
just you and me


this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye


this is the last time you tell me i've got it wrong
this is the last time i say, $it's been you all along$
this is the last time i let you in my door
this is the last time, i won't hurt you anymore
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh

this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye
this is the last time i'm asking you this $this is the last time i'm asking you this$
put my name at the top of your list $put my name at the top of your list$
this is the last time i'm asking you why $this is the last time i'm asking you why$
you break my heart in the blink of an eye $you break my heart$

this is the last time i'm asking you, last time i'm asking you
last time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you, last time i'm asking you
last time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you, last time i'm asking you
last time i'm asking you this
this is the last time i'm asking you, last time i'm asking you
last time i'm asking you this~new to town with a made$up name
in the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
and the camera flashes make it look like a dream
you had it figured out since you were in school
everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
so overnight, you look like a sixties queen


another name goes up in lights
like diamonds in the sky


and they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
but can you tell me now, you're the lucky one$
oh, oh, oh


and now, it's big black cars and riviera views
and your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
and they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
and all the young things line up to take your place


another name goes up in lights
you wonder if you'll make it out alive


and they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
can you tell me now, you're the lucky one$
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh


it was a few years later, i showed up here
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
how you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
chose the rose garden over madison square
and it took some time, but i understand it now


'cause now my name is up in lights
but i think you got it right


let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh~you should've been there
should've burst through the door
with that $baby, i'm right here$ smile
and it would've felt like
a million little shining stars that just align
and i would've been so happy


christmas lights glisten
i've got my eye on the door
just waiting for you to walk in
but the time is ticking
people ask me how i've been
as i comb back through my memory
how you said you'd be here
you said you'd be here


and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all laughing
as i'm looking around the room
but ther$ was one thing missing
and that was the moment i kn$w


and the hours pass by
now i just wanna be alone
but your close friends always seem to know
when there's something really wrong
so they follow me down the hall
and there in the bathroom
i try not to fall apart
and the sinking feeling starts
as i say hopelessly
$he said he'd be here$


and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all laughing
and asking me about you
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew


what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know$
and what do you do
when the one who means the most to you
is the one who didn't show$

you should've been here
and i would've been so happy


and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all standing around me, singing
$happy birthday to you$
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
oh$oh$oh$oh$oh$oh$oh, i knew
oh$oh$oh$oh$oh$oh$oh


you called me later
and said, $i'm sorry i didn't make it$
and i said, $i'm sorry, too$
and that was the moment i knew~i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night


and so it goes
every weekend, this same party
i never go alone
and i don't seem broken$hearted
my friends all say they know
everything i'm going through
i drive down different roads
but they all lead back to you


'cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
they weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
didn't read the note on the polaroid picture
they don't know how much i miss you


i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night


and so it was
we never saw it comin'
not trying to fall in love
but we did like children runnin'
back then, we didn't know
we were built to fall apart
we broke the status quo
then we broke each other's hearts


but don't forget about the night out in l$a
dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
no one knows about the words that we whispered
no one knows how much i miss you


i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night


take me away, take me away
take me away to you, to you
take me away, take me away
take me away to you, to you

i remember the night at the hotel
i was ridin' in the car when we both fell
i'm the one on the phone as you whisper
$do you know how much i miss you$$


i wish that we could go back in time
and i'd say to you
$i miss you like it was the very first night$


i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night


take me away $take me$, take me away $take me$
take me away $take me$ to you, to you
take me away $take me$, take me away $take me$
take me away $take me$ to you, to you~put your lips close to mine
as long as they don't touch
out of focus, eye to eye
'til the gravity's too much
and i'll do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and i'd be smart to walk away
but you're quicksand


this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i$i$i like it


i can't decide if it's a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow
but you're friction


this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
i$i$i like it


two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you a, get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home


this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
i$i$i, i$i$i, i$i$i $ 


two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you a, get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i will follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home

this slope is treacherous
i$i$i like it~i remember when we broke up
the first time, sayin', $this is it, i've had enough$
'cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
when you said you needed space $what$$
then you come around again and say
$baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change$
$trust me,$ remember how that lasted for a day$
i say, $i hate you,$ we break up, you call me, $i love you$


ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh
we called it off again last night, but
ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh
this time, i'm telling you, i'm telling you


we are never, ev$r, ever getting back tog$ther
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


like, ever


i'm really gonna miss you picking fights
and me falling for it, screaming that i'm right
and you would hide away and find your peace of mind
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine


ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh
you called me up again tonight, but
ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh
this time, i'm telling you, i'm telling you


we $we$ are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me $talk to me$
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh $yeah$
ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh $yeah$
ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh $yeah$
oh


i used to think that we were forever, ever
and i used to say, $never say never$
ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, $i still love you$
and i'm, like, i'm just, i mean, this is exhausting, you know$
like, we are never getting back together
like, ever $no$

we are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever $ooh$ getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


we $ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh$

we $ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh$
oh, getting back together, yeah $ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh$
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me $talk to me$
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together~i blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
put you in jail for something you didn't do
i pinned your hands behind your back, oh
thought i had reason to attack, but no


fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
why'd i have to break what i love so much$
it's on your face, and i'm to blame, i need to say


hey, it's all me, in my head
i'm the one who burned us down
but it's not what i meant
sorry that i hurt you
i don't wanna do, i don't wanna do this to you $ooh$
i don't wanna lose, i don't wanna lose this with you $ooh$
i need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
meet me in the afterglow


it's so excruciating to see you low
just wanna lift you up and not let you go
this ultraviolet morning light below
tells me this love is worth the fight, oh


i lived like an island, punished you with silence
went off like sirens, just crying
why'd i have to break what i love so much$
it's on your face, don't walk away, i need to say


hey, it's all me, in my head
i'm the one who burned us down
but it's not what i meant
i'm sorry that i hurt you
i don't wanna do, i don't wanna do this to you $ooh$
i don't wanna lose, i don't wanna lose this with you $ooh$
i need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
meet me in the afterglow


tell me that you're still mine
tell me that we'll be just fine
even when i lose my mind
i need to say
tell me that it's not my fault
tell me that i'm all you want
even when i break your heart
i need to say

hey, it's all me, in my head
i'm the one who burned us down
but it's not what i meant
sorry that i hurt you
i don't wanna do, i don't wanna do this to you $ooh$
i don't wanna lose, i don't wanna lose this with you $ooh$
i need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
meet me in the afterglow~we were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
$i rent a place on cornelia street$
i say casually in the car
we were a fresh page on the desk
filling in the blanks as we go
as if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
leading us home


and i hope i never lose you, hope it never ends
i'd never walk cornelia street again
that's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
i'd never walk cornelia street again
and baby, i get mystified by how this city screams your name
and baby, i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again


windows flung right open, autumn air
jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
we bless the rains on cornelia street
memorize the creaks in the floor
back when we were card sharks, playing games
i thought you were leading me on
i packed my bags, left cornelia street
before you even knew i was gone


but then you called, showed your hand
i turned around before i hit the tunnel
sat on the roof, you and i


i hope i never lose you, hope it never ends
i'd never walk cornelia street again
that's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
i'd never walk cornelia street again
and baby, i get mystified by how this city screams your name $city screams your name$
and baby, i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again

you hold my hand on the street
walk me back to that apartment
years ago, we were just inside
barefoot in the kitchen
sacred new beginnings
that became my religion, listen


i hope i never lose you
i'd never walk cornelia street again
oh, never again
and baby, i get mystified by how this city screams your name $city screams your name$
and baby, i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again

i don't wanna lose you $hope it never ends$
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i don't wanna lose you $yeah$


$i rent a place on cornelia street$
i say casually in the car~$yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah$


fever dream high in the quiet of the night
you know that i caught it $oh yeah, you're right, i want it$
bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
you know that i bought it $oh yeah, you're right, i want it$


killing me slow, out the window
i'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
what doesn't kill me makes me want you more


and it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, woah$oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, woah$oh
it's a cruel summer with you


hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
i'm not dying $oh yeah, you're right, i want it$
we say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
we're not trying $oh yeah, you're right, i want it$


so cut the headlights, summer's a knife
i'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
and if i bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh


it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, woah$oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, woah$oh
it's a cruel summer with you


i'm drunk in the back of the car
and i cried like a baby comin' home from the bar $oh$
said, $i'm fine,$ but it wasn't true
i don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
and i snuck in through the garden gate
every night that summer just to seal my fate $oh$
and i scream, $for whatever it's worth
i love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard$$
he looks up, grinnin' like a devil

it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, woah$oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, woah$oh
it's a cruel summer with you


i'm drunk in the back of the car
and i cried like a baby comin' home from the bar $oh$
said, $i'm fine,$ but it wasn't true
i don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
and i snuck in through the garden gate
every night that summer just to seal my fate $oh$
and i scream, $for whatever it's worth
i love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard$$
$yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah$~my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in
everyone looked worse in the light
there are so many lines that i've crossed unforgiven
i'll tell you the truth but never goodbye


i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
i've been sleepin' so long in a twenty$year dark night
and now i see daylight, i only see daylight


luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
and so i became the butt of the joke
i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked
clearin' the air, i breathed in the smoke


maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
maybe i've stormed out of every single room in this town
threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
it's brighter now, now


i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
$i can never look away$
i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
$things will never be the same$
i've been sleepin' so long in a twenty$year dark night
$now i'm wide awake$
and now i see daylight $daylight$, i only see daylight $daylight$


i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


and i can still see it all $in my mind$
all of you, all of me $intertwined$
i once believed love would be $black and white$
but it's golden $golden$
and i can still see it all $in my head$
back and forth from new york $sneakin' in your bed$
i once believed love would be $burnin' red$
but it's golden
like daylight, like daylight
like daylight, daylight


i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
$i can never look away$
and i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
$things will never be the same$
i've been sleepin' so long in a twenty$year dark night
$now i'm wide awake$
and now i see daylight $i see daylight$, i only see daylight $ah$


i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight $ah$
$and i can still see it all$
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
$and i can still see it all, back and forth from new york$
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
$i once believed love would be burning red$

like daylight
it's golden like daylight
you gotta step into the daylight and let it go
just let it go, let it go

i wanna be defined by the things that i love
not the things i hate
not the things i'm afraid of, i'm afraid of
or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
i, i just think that
you are what you love~my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my


saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk, but it's not enough
'cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts


i dress to kill my time, i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
they say, $i don't know$
and what once was ours is no one's now
i see you everywhere, the only thing we share
is this small town
you said it was a great love, one for the ages
but if the story's over, why am i still writing pages$


'cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk, but it's not enough
'cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts


my heart, my hips, my body, my love
tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
gave up on me like i was a bad drug
now i'm searching for signs in a haunted club
our songs, our films, united we stand
our country, guess it was a lawless land
quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
paper cut stings from our paper$thin plans
my time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
but i'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts


i get drunk, but it's not enough
'cause you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
no, it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts $you didn't touch$

tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
my body, my love, my trust $it's death by a thousand cuts$
but it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no


i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
they say, $i don't know~we were crazy to think
crazy to think that this could work
remember how i said i'd die for you$
we were stupid to jump
in the ocean separating us
remember how i'd fly to you$


and i can't talk to you when you're like this
staring out the window like i'm not your favorite town
i'm new york city
i still do it for you, babe
they all warned us about times like this
they say the road gets hard and you get lost
when you're led by blind faith, blind faith


but we might just get away with it
religion's in your lips
even if it's a false god
we'd still worship
we might just get away with it
the altar is my hips
even if it's a false god
we'd still worship this love
we'd still worship this love
we'd still worship this love


i know heaven's a thing
i go there when you touch me, honey
hell is when i fight with you
but we can patch it up good
make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
got the wine for you


and you can't talk to me when i'm like this
daring you to leave me just so i can try and scare you
you're the west village
you still do it for me, babe
they all warned us about times like this
they say the road gets hard and you get lost
when you're led by blind faith, blind faith


but we might just get away with it
religion's in your lips
even if it's a false god
we'd still worship
we might just get away with it
the altar is my hips
even if it's a false god
we'd still worship this love
we'd still worship this love
we'd still worship this love, ah

still worship this love
even if it's a false god
even if it's a false god
still worship this love~how many days did i spend thinking
'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong$
lived in the shade you were throwing
'til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
and i couldn't get away from ya
in my feelings more than drake, so yeah
your name on my lips, tongue$tied
free rent, living in my mind


but then something happened one magical night


i forgot that you existed
and i thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
and it was so nice
so peaceful and quiet
i forgot that you existed
it isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
i forgot that you


got out some popcorn
as soon as my rep started going down, down, down
laughed on the school yard
as soon as i tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
and i would've stuck around for ya
would've fought the whole town, so yeah
would've been right there, front row
even if nobody came to your show


but you showed who you are, then one magical night


i forgot that you existed
and i thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
and it was so nice
so peaceful and quiet
i forgot that you existed
it isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
i forgot that you


sent me a clear message
taught me some hard lessons
i just forget what they were
it's all just a blur


i forgot that you existed
and i thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
and it was so nice
so peaceful and quiet
i forgot that you existed
i did, i did, i did
it isn't hate, it's just indifference
it isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
so, yeah~i think he knows

waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
i'm lost in the lights
american glory faded before me
now i'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
running through rose thorns, i saw the scoreboard
and ran for my life $ah$


no cameras catch my pageant smile
i counted days, i counted miles
to see you there, to see you there
it's been a long time coming, but


it's you and me, that's my whole world
they whisper in the hallway, $she's a bad, bad girl$ $okay$
the whole school is rolling fake dice
you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
it's you and me, there's nothing like this
miss americana and the heartbreak prince $okay$
we're so sad, we paint the town blue
voted most likely to run away with you


my team is losing, battered and bruising
i see the high fives between the bad guys
leave with my head hung, you are the only one
who seems to care
american stories burning before me
i'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
boys will be boys then, where are the wise men$
darling, i'm scared $ah$


no cameras catch my muffled cries
i counted days, i counted miles
to see you there, to see you there
and now the storm is coming, but


it's you and me, that's my whole world
they whisper in the hallway, $she's a bad, bad girl$ $okay$
the whole school is rolling fake dice
you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
it's you and me, there's nothing like this
miss americana and the heartbreak prince $okay$
we're so sad, we paint the town blue
voted most likely to run away with you

like your friends were the night that we first met
went home and tried to stalk you on the internet

the wine is cold
like the shoulder that i gave you in the street
cat and mouse for a month or two or three
now i wake up in the night and watch you breathe

uh$huh, that's right
darling, you're the one i want
in paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
oh, you're the one i want


in the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
when you jumped in first, i went in too
i'm with you even if it makes me blue
which takes me back
to the color that we painted your brother's wall
honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
we wouldn't be standing here so tall, so


$ayy$
kiss you once 'cause i know you had a long night $oh$

i've been the archer, i've been the prey
who could ever leave me, darling

dark side, i search for your dark side
but what if i'm alright, right, right, right here$

then i hate my reflection for years and years


i wake in the night, i pace like a ghost
the room is on fire, invisible smoke
and all of my heroes die all alone
help me hold on to you


i've been the archer, i've been the prey
screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
but who could stay$
$i see right through me, i see right through me$

combat, i'm ready for combat~i would be complex, i would be cool
they'd say i played the field before i found someone to commit to
and that would be okay for me to do
every conquest i had made would make me more of a boss to you


i'd be a fearless leader, i'd be an alpha type
when everyone believes ya, what's that like$


i'm so sick of running as fast as i can
wonderin' if i'd get there quicker if i was a man
and i'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'cause if i was a man, then i'd be the man
i'd be the man $man$
i'd be the man $man$


they'd say i hustled, put in the work
they wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this i deserve
what i was wearing, if i was rude
could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves


and they would toast to me, oh $ayy$, let the players play
i'd be just like leo in saint$tropez


i'm so sick of running as fast as i can
wonderin' if i'd get there quicker if i was a man
and i'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'cause if i was a man, then i'd be the man
i'd be the man $man$
i'd be the man $man$


what's it like to brag about raking in dollars
and getting bitches and models$
and it's all good if you're bad
and it's okay if you're mad
if i was out flashin' my dollars
i'd be a bitch, not a baller
they'd paint me out to be bad
so it's okay that i'm mad


i'm so sick of running as fast as i can
wonderin' if i'd get there quicker if i was a man $you know that$
and i'm so sick of them comin' at me again $comin' at me again$
'cause if i was a man $if i was a man$, then i'd be the man $then i'd be the man$
i'm so sick of running as fast as i can $as fast as i can$
wonderin' if i'd get there quicker if i was a man $hey$
and i'm so sick of them comin' at me again $comin' at me again$
'cause if i was a man $if i was a man$, then i'd be the man
i'd be the man $man$
i'd be the man $man, oh$
i'd be the man $man, yeah$
i'd be the man $man, i'd be the man$

if i was a man
then i'd be the man~you are somebody that i don't know
but you're takin' shots at me like it's patr$n
and i'm just like, damn, it's $ am
say it in the street, that's a knock$out
but you say it in a tweet, that's a cop$out
and i'm just like, $hey, are you okay$$


and i ain't tryna mess with your self$expression
but i've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
and snakes and stones never broke my bones


so oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh
you need to calm down, you're being too loud
and i'm just like oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh $oh$
you need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown$
you need to calm down


you are somebody that we don't know
but you're comin' at my friends like a missile
why are you mad when you could be glaad$ $you could be glaad$
sunshine on the street at the parade
but you would rather be in the dark ages
makin' that sign must've taken all night


you just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
and control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'cause shade never made anybody less gay


so oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh
you need to calm down, you're being too loud
and i'm just like oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh, oh$oh $oh$

you need to just stop $can you stop$$
like can you just not step on our gowns$
you need to calm down~when you think of all the late nights
lame fights over the phone
wake up in the mornin' with someone
but feelin' alone


a heart is drawn around your name
in someone's handwriting, not mine
sneakin' out into town
holdin' hands, just killin' time


your past and mine are parallel lines
stars all aligned and they intertwined
and taught you
the way you call me $baby$
treat me like a lady
all that i can say is


all of the girls you loved before $ooh$
made you the one i've fallen for
every dead$end street led you straight to me
now you're all i need, i'm so thankful for
all of the girls you loved before

when i think of all the makeup
fake love out on the town $ooh$
cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
whose name i cannot remember now


secret jokes all alone
no one's home, sixteen and wild $ooh$
breakin' up, makin' up

you stand with your hand on my waistline
it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
it's a bad sign, bad sign
somethin' happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circlin', dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
it could burn out


'cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
they are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


baby, i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'cause i, i know places we can hide
i know places, i know places


lights flash and we'll run for the fences
let them say what they want, we won't hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time


just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
they are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


baby $baby$, i know places we won't be found
and they'll $they'll$ be $be$ chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

once the flight had flown $uh$huh$
with the wilt of the rose $uh$huh$
i slept all alone $uh$huh$
you still wouldn't go


let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
i see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
you dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby


was it over when she laid down on your couch$
was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse$
$come here,$ i whispered in your ear
in your dream as you pass$d out, baby
was it over then$ and is it over now$


$is it$ is it$ is it$$


wh$n you lost control $uh$huh$
red blood, white snow $uh$huh$
blue dress on a boat $uh$huh$
your new girl is my clone


and did you think i didn't see you$
there were flashin' lights
at least i had the decency
to keep my nights out of sight
only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
and my whispered sighs
oh, lord, i think about jumpin'
off of very tall somethings
just to see you come runnin'
and say the one thing i've been wanting, but no


let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later $oh$
if she's got blue eyes, i will surmise that you'll probably date her $oh, no$
you dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor $oh$
you search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby


was it over when she laid down on your couch$
was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse$
$come here,$ i whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out, baby
was it over then$ and is it over now$


uh$huh
$is it$ is it$ is it$$
uh$huh
$is it$ is it$$

think i didn't see you$
there were flashin' lights
at least i had the decency
to keep my nights out of sight
only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
and my whispered sighs
oh, lord, i think about jumpin'
off of very tall somethings
just to see you come runnin' $runnin'$
and say the one thing i've been wanting, but no


$flashin' lights$ oh, lord$ oh$
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later $oh$
$flashin' lights$ i was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing $oh, lord$
i've been wanting $oh, lord$
but no~it's $ am in your car
windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
you say, $it's in the past,$ you drive straight ahead

makes you want to run and hide
then it makes you turn right back around


i wish you would come back

wish you knew that
i'll never forget you as long as i live and i

i wish you would~we're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
we wait for trains that just aren't comin'
we show off our different scarlet letters
trust me, mine is better
we're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
we play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
honey, life is just a classroom
ah$ah$ah$ah$ah$ah


'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and ev$ry day is like a battle
but ev$ry night with us is like a dream
baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free


we're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
we hang back, it's all in the timing
it's poker, he can't see it in my face
but i'm about to play my ace, ah
we need love, but all we want is danger
we team up, then switch sides like a record changer
the rumors are terrible and cruel
but, honey, most of them are true
ah$ah$ah$ah$ah$ah


'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancin' $yeah$ to get knocked off our feet $hey$
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free


$oh, oh, oh$oh, oh$ oh
$oh, oh, oh$oh, oh$ so, come on, come along with me
$oh, oh, oh$oh, oh$ the best people in life are free
$oh, oh, oh$oh, oh$


please, take my hand and
please, take me dancin' and
please, leave me stranded
it's so romantic $it's so romantic$
ah$ah$ah$ah$ah$ah


'cause, baby, i could build a castle $oh, baby, i could build a castle$
out of all the bricks they threw at me $at me$
and every day is like a battle $oh$
but every night with us is like a dream $is like a dream$
'cause baby, i could build a castle $castle$
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle $and every day is like a battle, oh$
but every night with us is like a dream
baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancin' $hey$ to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free~you went to a party
i heard from everybody
you part the crowd like the red sea
don't even get me started
did you get anxious though
on the way home$
i guess i'll never, ever know
now that we don't talk


you grew your hair long
you got new icons
and from the outside
it looks like you're tryin' lives on
i miss the old ways
you didn't have to change
but i guess i don't have a say
now that we don't talk


i call my mom, she said that it was for the best
remind myself, the mor$ i gave, you'd want me less
i cannot b$ your friend, so i pay the price of what i lost
and what it cost, now that we don't talk


what do you tell your friends we
shared dinners, long weekends with$
truth is, i can't pretend it's
platonic, it's just ended, so


i call my mom, she said to get it off my chest $off my chest$
remind myself the way you faded 'til i left $until i left$
i cannot be your friend, so i pay the price of what i lost $of what i lost$
and what it cost, now that we don't talk


i don't have to pretend i like acid rock
or that i'd like to be on a mega yacht
with important men who think important thoughts
guess maybe i am better off now that we don't talk
and the only way back to my dignity
was to turn into a shrouded mystery
just like i had been when you were chasing me
guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk~looking at it now
it all seems so simple
we were lying on your couch
i remember
you took a polaroid of us
then discovered $then discovered$
the rest of the world was black and white
but we were in screaming color
and i remember thinkin'


are we out of the woods yet$ are we out of the woods yet$

ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
the night we couldn't quite forget

two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

in my peripheral vision
i let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
all was quickly forgiven
you were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
flush with the currency of cool
i was always turnin' out my empty pockets
and when it came to you


i didn't come here to make friends
we were born to be suburban legends
when you hold me, it holds me together
and you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever


i had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
would surprise the whole school
when i ended up back at our class reunion
walkin' in with you
you'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
with the pages ripped out
i am standin' in a $$$$s gymnasium
and i can still see you now


i didn't come here to make friends
we were born to be suburban legends
when you hold me, it holds me together
and you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
i know that you still remember
we were born to be national treasures
when you told me we'd get back together
and you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

you never saw it comin', slipped when you started runnin'
and now you've come undone and i, i, i, i

seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
wish i could make it better, someday, you won't remember
this pain you thought would last forever and ever and

i will say, $i knew it all along$
your eyes, wider than distance
this life is sweeter than fiction


just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh, oh

high tide came and brought you in
and i could go on and on, on and on, and i will
skies grew darker
currents swept you out again
and you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


in silent screams, in wildest dreams
i never dreamed of this


this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead, oh
these hands had to let it go free and
this love came back to me, oh
oh, oh


tossing, turning
struggled through the night with someone new
baby, i could go on and on, on and on
lantern, burning
flickered in my mind for only you
but you were still gone, gone, gone


in losin' grip, on sinking ships
you showed up just in time


this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead, oh
these hands had to let it go free and
this love came back to me, oh
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark, oh
these hands had to let it go free and
this love came back to me, oh


$this love, this love, this love, this love, oh$
$this love, this love, this love, this love, oh$
$this love, this love, this love, this love, oh$
$this love, this love, this love, this love$


your kiss, my cheek, i watched you leave
your smile, my ghost, i fell to my knees
when you're young, you just run
but you come back to what you need

this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead, oh
these hands had to let it go free and
this love came back to me, oh
$this love$ this love left a permanent mark
$this love$ this love is glowing in the dark, oh
$this love$ these hands had to let it go free and
$this love$ this love came back to me, oh


$this love, this love, this love, this love, oh$
$this love, this love, this love, this love, oh$
$this love, this love, this love, this love$
$this love$ this love came back to me, oh~walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
everybody here wanted somethin' more
searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
and it said


$welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you$
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
it's a new soundtrack, i could dance to this beat, beat forevermor$
the lights are so bright, but they n$ver blind me, me
welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york


when we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
everybody here was someone else before
and you can want who you want
boys and boys and girls and girls


welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you

welcome to new york $new york$, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york


like any great love, it keeps you guessing
like any real love, it's ever$changing
like any true love, it drives you crazy
but you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york

the lights are so bright, but they never blind me
welcome to new york, so bright, they never blind me
welcome to new york, welcome to new york~he said, $let's get out of this town
drive out of the city, away from the crowds$
i thought, $heaven can't help me now$
nothing lasts forever
but this is gonna take me down

in your wildest dreams, ah, ha~flashin' lights
and we took a wrong turn
and we fell down a rabbit hole
you held on tight to me
'cause nothing's as it seems
and spinning out of control


didn't they tell us, $don't rush into things$$
didn't you flash your green eyes at me$
haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds$
ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'$
i felt your arms twistin' around me
i should have slept with one eye open at night


we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever, eh
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse, but nev$r better, eh, $h


in wonderland
in wonderland
in wonderland
in wonderland


so, we went on our way
too in love to think straight
all alone or so it seemed
but there were strangers watchin'
and whispers turned to talkin'
and talking turned to screams, oh


didn't they tell us, $don't rush into things$$
didn't you flash your green eyes at me$
didn't you calm my fears with a cheshire cat smile$
ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'$
i felt your arms twistin' around me
it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
but darlin'


we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever, eh
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh


in wonderland, eh, eh
in wonderland
in wonderland, woah
in wonderland

i reached for you, but you were gone
i knew i had to go back home
you searched the world for somethin' else
to make you feel like what we had
and in the end, in wonderland, we both went mad
oh


we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever $could last forever$
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it $got lost in it$
and life was never worse, but never better $never better$
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it $in wonderland$
and we pretended it could last forever $in wonderland$
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it $in wonderland$
and life was never worse, but never better
in wonderland~one look, dark room, meant just for you
time moved too fast, you play it back
buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
no proof, not much, but you saw enough
small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
the light reflects the chain on your neck
he says, $look up$ and your shoulders brush
no proof, one touch, but you felt enough


you can hear it in the silence $silence$, silence $silence$, you
you can feel it on the way home $way home$, way home $way home$, you
you can see it with the lights out $see it with the lights out$, lights out $lights out$
you are in love, true love, you are in lov$


morning, his place, burnt toast, sunday
you keep his shirt, he keeps his word
and for once, you l$t go of your fears and your ghosts
one step, not much, but it said enough
you kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk
one night, he wakes, strange look on his face
pauses, then says, $you're my best friend$
and you knew what it was, he is in love


you can hear it in the silence $silence$, silence $silence$, you
you can feel it on the way home $way home$, way home $way home$, you
you can see it with the lights out $see it with the lights out$, lights out $lights out$
you are in love, true love, you are in love


and so it goes
you two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now
why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i've spent my whole life trying to put it into words


'cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love, true love, you are in love


you can hear it in the silence $silence$, silence $silence$, you
you can feel it on the way home $way home$, way home $way home$, you
you can see it with the lights out $see it with the lights out$, lights out $lights out$
you are in love, true love, you are in love $ah$
you can hear it in the silence $silence$, silence $silence$, you $ah$
you can feel it on the way home $way home$, way home $way home$, you $ah$
you can see it with the lights out $see it with the lights out$, lights out $lights out$
you are in love, true love, you are in love~i have this thing where i get older, but just never wiser
midnights become my afternoons
when my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
i've ghosted stand there in the room


i should not be left to my own devices
they come with prices and vices
i end up in crisis
$tale as old as time$
i wake up screaming from dreaming
one day, i'll watch as you're leaving
'cause you got tired of my scheming
$for the last time$


it's me, hi
i'm the problem, it's me
at teatime, everybody agrees
i'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
it must be exhausting always rooting for the anti$hero


sometimes, i feel like everybody is a sexy baby
and i'm a monster on the hill
too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
pierced through the heart, but never killed


did you hear my covert narcissism i disguise as altruism
like some kind of congressman$
$a tale as old as time$
i wake up screaming from dreaming
one day, i'll watch as you're leaving
and life will lose all its meaning
$for the last time$


it's me, hi
i'm the problem, it's me $i'm the problem, it's me$
at teatime, everybody agrees
i'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
it must be exhausting always rooting for the anti$hero


i have this dream my daughter$in$law kills me for the money
she thinks i left them in the will
the family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
$she's laughing up at us from hell$


it's me, hi
i'm the problem, it's me
it's me, hi
i'm the problem, it's me
it's me, hi
everybody agrees, everybody agrees

it's me, hi $hi$
i'm the problem, it's me $i'm the problem, it's me$
at teatime $teatime$, everybody agrees $everybody agrees$
i'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
it must be exhausting always rooting for the anti$hero~baby love, i think i've been a little too kind
didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
in the shoes i gave you as a present
puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
and by the way, i'm goin' out tonight


best believe i'm still bejeweled
when i walk in the room
i can still make the whole place shimmer
and when i meet the band
they ask, $do you have a man$$
i could still say, $i don't remember$
familiarity breeds contempt
don't put m$ in the basement
wh$n i want the penthouse of your heart
diamonds in my eyes
i polish up real, i polish up real nice


nice


baby boy, i think i've been too good of a girl $too good of a girl$
did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
i think it's time to teach some lessons
i made you my world $huh$, have you heard$ $huh$
i can reclaim the land
and i miss you $miss you$, but i miss sparklin' $nice$


best believe i'm still bejeweled
when i walk in the room
i can still make the whole place shimmer
and when i meet the band
they ask, $do you have a man$$
i could still say, $i don't remember$
familiarity breeds contempt
don't put me in the basement
when i want the penthouse of your heart
diamonds in my eyes
i polish up real, i polish up real nice


nice


sapphire tears on my face
sadness became my whole sky
but some guy said my aura's moonstone
just 'cause he was high
and we're dancin' all night
and you can try to change my mind
but you might have to wait in line
what's a girl gonna do$
a diamond's gotta shine

best believe i'm still bejeweled
when i walk in the room
i can still make the whole place shimmer $shimmer$
and when i meet the band
they ask, $do you have a man$$
i could still say, $i don't remember$
familiarity breeds contempt
don't put me in the basement
when i want the penthouse of your heart
diamonds in my eyes
i polish up real $nice$, i polish up real nice


and we're dancin' all night
and you can try to change my mind
but you might have to wait in line
what's a girl gonna do$ what's a girl gonna do$
i polish up nice
best believe i'm still bejeweled
when i walk in the room
i can still make the whole place shimmer~no words appear before me in the aftermath
salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
every single thing i touch becomes sick with sadness
'cause it's all over now, all out to sea


goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
you were bigger than the whole sky
you were more than just a short time
and i've got a lot to pine about
i've got a lot to live without
i'm never gonna meet
what could've been, would've been
what should've been you
what could've been, would've been you


did some bird flap its wings ov$r in asia$
did some force take you b$cause i didn't pray$
every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
so i'll say words i don't believe


goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
you were bigger than the whole sky
you were more than just a short time
and i've got a lot to pine about
i've got a lot to live without
i'm never gonna meet
what could've been, would've been
what should've been you


what could've been, would've been you
what could've been, would've been
what should've been you
what could've been, would've been you
$what could've been, would've been you$


goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
you were bigger than the whole sky
you were more than just a short time
and i've got a lot to pine about
i've got a lot to live without
i'm never gonna meet
what could've been, would've been
what should've been you~dear reader, if it feels like a trap
you're already in one
dear reader, get out your map
pick somewhere and just run
dear reader, burn all the files
desert all your past lives
and if you don't recognize yourself
that means you did it right


never take advice from someone who's falling apart
never take advice from someone who's falling apart $you should find another$


dear reader, bend when you can
snap when you have to
dear reader, you don't have to answer
just 'cause they asked you
$you should find another$
dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
dear reader, when you aim at the devil
make sure you don't miss


never take advice from someone who's falling apart
never take advice from someone who's falling apart


so i wander through these nights
i prefer hiding in plain sight
my fourth drink in my hand
these desperate prayers of a cursed man
spilling out to you for free
but darling, darling, please
you wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
if you knew where i was walking
to a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
where i pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
no one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire


you should find another guiding light, guiding light
but i shine so bright
you should find another guiding light, guiding light
but i shine so bright
you should find another, you should find another $guiding light$
find another, you should find another
you should find another~we were supposed to be just friends
you don't live in my part of town, but maybe i'll see you out some weekend
depending on what kind of mood and situationship i'm in
and what's in my system


i think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
five seconds later, i'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
and i'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
blood moonlit
it must be counterfeit
i think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah


i was supposed to sweat you out
in search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
but it's been two$thousand one$hundred ninety days of our love blackout
$our love is blacking out$
the system's breaking down
$the system's breaking down$


i think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
five seconds later, i'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
and i'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
blood moonlit
it must be counterfeit
i think there's been a glitch


a brief interruption, a slight malfunction
i'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
i thought we had no chance
and that's romance, let's dance


glitch, oh, yeah
five seconds later, i'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
and i'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
blood moonlit
it must be counterfeit $it must be counterfeit$
i think there's been a glitch~lock broken, slur spoken
wound open, game token
i didn't know you were keeping count
rain soaking, blind hoping
you said i was freeloading
i didn't know you were keeping count


high infidelity
put on your records and regret me
i bent the truth too far tonight
i was dancing around, dancing around it
high infidelity
put on your headphones and burn my city
your picket fence is sharp as knives
i was dancing around, dancing around it


do you really wanna know where i was april $$th$
do i really have to chart the constellations in his eyes$


storm coming, good husband
bad omen
dragged my feet right down the aisle
at the house lonely, good money
i'd pay if you'd just know me
seemed like the right thing at the time


you know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
the slowest way is never loving them enough
do you really wanna know where i was april $$th$
do i really have to tell you how he brought me back to life$

lock broken, slur spoken
wound open, game token
i didn't know you were keeping count
rain soaking, blind hoping
you said i was freeloading
i didn't know you were keeping count
but, oh, you were keeping count~you're talking shit for the hell of it
addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
you're terrified to look down
'cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
of everyone you burned just to get there
it's coming back around


and i keep my side of the street clean
you wouldn't know what i mean


'cause karma is my boyfriend

and you don't really read into
my melancholia

all this shit is new to me $yeah, oh, yeah$

get it off your chest
get it off my desk
that lavender haze
i just wanna stay
i just wanna stay in that lavender haze~when the morning came
we were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'cause we lost track of time again
laughing with my feet in your lap
like you were my closest friend
$how'd we end up on the floor, anyway$$ you say
$your roommate's cheap$ass screw$top ros$, that's how$
i see you every day now


and i chose you
the one i was dancing with
in new york, no shoes
looked up at the sky and it was
the burgundy on my t$shirt
when you splashed your wine into me
and how the blood rushed into my cheeks
so scarlet, it was
the mark th$y saw on my collarbone
the rust that grew b$tween telephones
the lips i used to call home
so scarlet, it was maroon


when the silence came
we were shaking, blind and hazy
how the hell did we lose sight of us again$
sobbing with your head in your hands
ain't that the way shit always ends$
you were standing hollow$eyed in the hallway
carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
i feel you, no matter what
the rubies that i gave up


and i lost you
the one i was dancing with
in new york, no shoes
looked up at the sky and it was $maroon$
the burgundy on my t$shirt
when you splashed your wine into me
and how the blood rushed into my cheeks
so scarlet, it was $maroon$
the mark they saw on my collarbone
the rust that grew between telephones
the lips i used to call home
so scarlet, it was maroon


and i wake with your memory over me
that's a real fucking legacy, legacy $it was maroon$
and i wake with your memory over me
that's a real fucking legacy to leave


the burgundy on my t$shirt
when you splashed your wine into me
and how the blood rushed into my cheeks
so scarlet, it was maroon
the mark they saw on my collarbone
the rust that grew between telephones
the lips i used to call home
so scarlet, it was maroon

it was maroon
it was maroon~once upon a time, the planets and the fates
and all the stars aligned
you and i ended up in the same room
at the same time


and the touch of a hand lit the fuse
of a chain reaction of countermoves
to assess the equation of you
checkmate, i couldn't lose


what if i told you none of it was accidental$
and the first night that you saw me
nothing was gonna stop me
i laid the groundwork, and then
just like clockwork
the dominoes cascaded in a line
what if i told you i'm a mastermind$
and now you're mine
it was all by d$sign
'cause i'm a mastermind


you see, all the wis$st women
had to do it this way
'cause we were born to be the pawn
in every lover's game


if you fail to plan, you plan to fail
strategy sets the scene for the tale
i'm the wind in our free$flowing sails
and the liquor in our cocktails


what if i told you none of it was accidental$
and the first night that you saw me
i knew i wanted your body
i laid the groundwork, and then
just like clockwork
the dominoes cascaded in a line
what if i told you i'm a mastermind$
and now you're mine
it was all my design
'cause i'm a mastermind


no one wanted to play with me as a little kid
so i've been scheming like a criminal ever since
to make them love me and make it seem effortless
this is the first time i've felt the need to confess
and i swear
i'm only cryptic and machiavellian
'cause i care

so i told you none of it was accidental
and the first night that you saw me
nothing was gonna stop me
i laid the groundwork, and then
saw a wide smirk on your face
you knew the entire time
you knew that i'm a mastermind
and now you're mine
yeah, all you did was smile
'cause i'm a mastermind~rain
he wanted it comfortable, i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride, i was making my own name
chasing that fame, he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight


my town was a wasteland
full of cages, full of fences
pageant queens and big pretenders
but for some, it was paradise
my boy was a montage
a slow$motion, love potion
jumping off things in the ocean
i broke his heart 'cause he was nice
he was sunshine, i was midnight rain


he wanted it comfortable, i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride, i was making my own name
chasing that fame, he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight


it came like a postcard
picture perfect shiny family
holiday peppermint candy
but for him, it's every day
so i peered through a window
a deep portal, time travel
all the love we unravel
and the life i gave away
'cause he was sunshine, i was midnight rain


he wanted it comfortable, i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride, i was making my own name
chasing that fame, he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight rain
he wanted it comfortable, i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride, i was making my own name
chasing that fame, he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight


i guess sometimes we all get
just what we wanted, just what we wanted
and he never thinks of me
except for when i'm on tv
i guess sometimes we all get
some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
and i never think of him
except on midnights like this
$midnights like this, midnights like this$~your ex$friend's sister
met someone at a club and he kissed her
turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
some wannabe z$lister
and all the outfits were terrible
$$$$ unbearable
did you see the photos$$
no, i didn't, but thanks, though


i'm so in love that i might stop breathing
drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
no, i didn't see the news
'cause we were somewhere else
stumbled down pretend alleyways
cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
i was taken by the view


like we were in paris
like we were somewhere else
like we were in paris, oh
we were somewhere else


privacy sign on the door
and on my page and on the whole world
romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
levitate above all the messes made
sit quiet by my side in the shade
and not the kind that's thrown
i mean, the kind under where a tree has grown


i'm so in love that i might stop breathing
drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
no, i didn't see the news
'cause we were somewhere else
stumbled down pretend alleyways
cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
i was taken by the view


like we were in paris, oh
like we were somewhere else
like we were in paris, oh
we were somewhere else


i wanna brainwash you
into loving me forever
i wanna transport you
to somewhere the culture's clever
confess my truth
in swooping, sloping, cursive letters
let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
in my mind


we drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
no, i didn't see the news
'cause we were somewhere else
in an alleyway, drinking champagne

'cause we were in paris
yes, we were somewhere else
my love, we were in paris
yes, we were somewhere else~i remember


good girl, sad boy
big city, wrong choices
we had one thing goin' on
i swear that it was somethin'
'cause i don't remember who i was
before you painted all my nights
a color i've searched for since
but one thing after another
fuckin' situations, circumstances
miscommunications, and i
have to say, by the way
i just may like some explanations


can i ask you a question$
did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
and every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
but fifteen seconds later, th$y were clappin' too$
then what did you do$
did you l$ave her house in the middle of the night$ oh
did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
when she said it was too much$
do you wish you could still touch her$
it's just a question


half$moon eyes, bad surprise
did you realize out of time$
she was on your mind with some dickhead guy
that you saw that night
but you were on somethin'
it was one drink after another
fuckin' politics and gender roles
and you're not sure and i don't know
got swept away in the gray
i just may like to have a conversation


can i ask you a question$
did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
and every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
but fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too$
then what did you do$
did you leave her house in the middle of the night$ oh
did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
when she said it was too much$
do you wish you could still touch her$
it's just a question


does it feel like everything's just like
second best after that meteor strike$
and what's that that i heard$ that you're still with her$
that's nice, i'm sure that's what's suitable
and right, but tonight

can i ask you a question$ $can i ask you a question$$
did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room $in a crowded room$
and every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you $makin' fun of you$
but fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too$
then what did you do$ $do$
did you leave her house in the middle of the night$ oh
did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh $more of a fight$
when she said it was too much$
do you wish you could still touch her$
it's just a question~one night, a few moons ago
i saw flecks of what could've been lights
but it might just have been you
passing by unbeknownst to me
life is emotionally abusive
and time can't stop me quite like you did
and my flight was awful, thanks for asking
i'm unglued, thanks to you


and it's like snow at the beach
weird, but fuckin' beautiful
flying in a dream
stars by the pocketful
you wanting me
tonight feels impossible
but it's comin' down
no sound, it's all around


like snow on the beach
like snow on the beach
like snow on the beach
like snow, ah


this scene feels like what i once saw on a screen
i searched $aurora borealis green$
i've never seen someone lit from within
blurring out my periphery
my smile is like i won a contest
and to hide that would be so dishonest
and it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'til you do, 'til it's true


now it's like snow at the beach
weird, but fuckin' beautiful
flying in a dream
stars by the pocketful
you wanting me
tonight feels impossible
but it's comin' down
no sound, it's all around


like snow on the beach
like snow on the beach
like snow on the beach
like snow, ah

i $i$ can't $can't$ speak, afraid to jinx it
i $i$ don't $don't$ even dare to wish it
but your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
now i'm all for you like janet
can this be a real thing$ can it$


are we falling like snow at the beach$ $snow at the beach$
weird, but fuckin' beautiful
flying in a dream $flying in a dream$
stars by the pocketful
you wanting me $you wanting me$
tonight feels impossible
but it's comin' down
no sound, it's all around


like snow on the beach $snow on the beach$
like snow on the beach $flying in a dream$
like snow on the beach $you wanting me$
like snow, ah
but it's comin' down
no sound, it's all around


like snow on the beach
$it's comin' down, it's comin' down$
$it's comin' down, it's comin' down$
like snow on the beach
$it's comin' down, it's comin' down$
$it's comin' down, it's comin' down$
$it's comin' down, it's comin' down$
$it's comin' down, it's comin' down$
$it's comin' down, it's comin' down$
$it's comin' down, it's comin' down$~i spy with my little tired eye
tiny as a firefly
a pebble that we picked up last july
down deep inside your pocket
we almost forgot it
does it ever miss wicklow sometimes$
ooh, ooh


they said the end is comin'
everyone's up to somethin'
i find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
outside, they're push and shovin'
you're in the kitchen hummin'
all that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'


on the way home
i wrote a poem
you say, $what a mind$
this happens all the time
ooh, ooh


'caus$ they said the end is comin'
ev$ryone's up to somethin'
i find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
outside, they're push and shovin'
you're in the kitchen hummin'
all that you ever wanted from me was nothin'


industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
and smooth$talking hucksters out glad$handing each other
and the voices that implore, $you should be doing more$
to you, i can admit that i'm just too soft for all of it
ooh


they said the end is comin'
everyone's up to somethin'
i find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
outside, they're push and shovin'
you're in the kitchen hummin'
all that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
they said the end is comin' $they said the end is comin'$
everyone's up to somethin' $everyone's up to somethin'$
i find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
outside, they're push and shovin' $outside, they're push and shovin'$
you're in the kitchen hummin' $you're in the kitchen hummin'$
all that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'~my knuckles were bruised like violets
sucker punching walls, cursed you as i sleep$talked
spineless in my tomb of silence
tore your banners down, took the battle underground
and maybe it was egos swinging
maybe it was her
flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur


all that bloodshed, crimson clover
uh$huh, sweet dream was over
my hand was the one you reached for
all throughout the great war
always remember
uh$huh, tears on the l$tter
i vowed not to cry anymore
if w$ survived the great war


you drew up some good faith treaties
i drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
you said i have to trust more freely
but diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
and maybe it's the past that's talking
screaming from the crypt
telling me to punish you for things you never did
so i justified it


all that bloodshed, crimson clover
uh$huh, the bombs were closer
my hand was the one you reached for
all throughout the great war
always remember
uh$huh, the burning embers
i vowed not to fight anymore
if we survived the great war


uh$huh, uh$huh


it turned into something bigger
somewhere in the haze, got a sense i'd been betrayed
your finger on my hairpin triggers
soldier down on that icy ground
looked up at me with honor and truth
broken and blue, so i called off the troops
that was the night i nearly lost you
i really thought i'd lost you


we can plant a memory garden
say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
there's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
and we will never go back

to that bloodshed, crimson clover
uh$huh, the worst was over
my hand was the one you reached for
all throughout the great war
always remember
uh$huh, we're burned for better
i vowed i would always be yours
'cause we survived the great war


uh$huh, uh$huh
i will always be yours
'cause we survived the great war
uh$huh
i vow i will always be yours~draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
you did some bad things, but i'm the worst of them
sometimes i wonder which one'll be your last lie
they say looks can kill and i might try
i don't dress for women
i don't dress for men
lately, i've been dressin' for revenge


i don't start shit, but i can tell you how it ends
don't get sad, get even
so on the weekends
i don't dress for friends
lately, i've been dressin' for revenge


she needed cold, hard proof, so i gave her some
she had the envelope, where you think she got it from$
now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
picture me thick as thieves with your ex$wife
and she looks so pretty
drivin' in your benz
lately, she's been dressin' for revenge


she don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
don't get sad, get even
so on the weekends
she don't dress for friends
lately, she's been dressing for revenge


ladies always rise above
ladies know what people want
someone sweet and kind and fun
the lady simply had enough


while he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
someone told his white$collar crimes to the fbi
and i don't dress for villains
or for innocents
i'm on my vigilante shit again


i don't start shit, but i can tell you how it ends
don't get sad, get even
so on the weekends
i don't dress for friends
lately, i've been dressin' for revenge~if you would've blinked, then i would've
looked away at the first glance
if you tasted poison, you could've
spit me out at the first chance
and if i was some paint, did it splatter
on a promising grown man$
and if i was a child, did it matter
if you got to wash your hands$


ooh, all i used to do was pray
would've, could've, should've
if you'd never looked my way


i would've stayed on my knees
and i damn sure never would've danced with the devil
at nineteen
and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
and now that i'm grown, i'm scared of ghosts
memories feel like weapons
and now that i know, i wish you'd left me wondering


if you never touched me, i would've
gone along with the righteous
if i never blushed, then they could've
never whispered about this
and if you never saved me from boredom
i could've gone on as i was
but, lord, you made me feel important
and then you tried to erase us


ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
would've, could've, should've
if i'd only played it safe


i would've stayed on my knees
and i damn sure never would've danced with the devil
at nineteen
and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
and now that i'm grown, i'm scared of ghosts
memories feel like weapons
and now that i know, i wish you'd left me wondering


god rest my soul
i miss who i used to be
the tomb won't close
stained glass windows in my mind
i regret you all the time
i can't let this go
i fight with you in my sleep
the wound won't close
i keep on waiting for a sign
i regret you all the time

if clarity's in death, then why won't this die$
years of tearing down our banners, you and i
living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
give me back my girlhood, it was mine first


and i damn sure never would've danced with the devil
at nineteen
and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
and now that i'm grown, i'm scared of ghosts
memories feel like weapons
and now that i know, i wish you'd left me wondering


god rest my soul
i miss who i used to be
the tomb won't close
stained glass windows in my mind
i regret you all the time
i can't let this go
i fight with you in my sleep
the wound won't close
i keep on waiting for a sign
i regret you all the time
oh, god rest my soul
i miss who i used to be
the tomb won't close
stained glass windows in my mind
i regret you all the time
i can't let this go
i fight with you in my sleep
the wound won't close
i keep on waiting for a sign
i regret you all the time~summer went away, still, the yearning stays
i play it cool with the best of them
i wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
it's okay, we're the best of friends
anyway
i hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
i touch my phone as if it's your face
i didn't choose this town, i dream of getting out
there's just one who could make me stay
all my days


from sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
i waited ages to see you there
i search the party of better bodies
just to learn that you never cared


you're on your own, kid
you always have been


i see the great escape, so long, daisy may
i picked the petals, he loves me not
something different bloomed, writing in my room
i play my songs in the parking lot
i'll run away


from sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
i called a taxi to take me there
i search the party of better bodies
just to learn that my dreams aren't rare


you're on your own, kid
you always have been




from sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
i gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
i hosted parties and starved my body
like i'd be saved by a perfect kiss
the jokes weren't funny, i took the money
my friends from home don't know what to say
i looked around in a blood$soaked gown
and i saw something they can't take away
'cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
everything you lose is a step you take
so, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
you've got no reason to be afraid

you're on your own, kid
yeah, you can face this
you're on your own, kid
you always have been~why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart$
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now$
why would you wanna make
the very first scar$
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart$


maybe i should've seen the signs
should've read the writing on the wall
and realized by the distance in your eyes
that i would be the one to fall


no matter what you say
i still can't believe that you would walk away
it don't make sense to me, but


why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart$
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now$
why would you wanna make
the very first scar$
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart$


it's not unbroken anymore $it's not unbroken anymore$
how do i get it back the way it was before$


why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart$
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now$
why would you wanna make
the very first scar$
why would you wanna break $ 
$why$ would you wanna break it$


why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart$
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now$
why would you wanna make
the very first scar$
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart$


mmm$hmm~i don't know what i want, so don't ask me
'cause i'm still trying to figure it out
don't know what's down this road, i'm just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though i'm not the only one
who feels the way i do


i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world


got the radio on, my old blue jeans
and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
could you tell me what more do i need$
and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
but that's okay


i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world


maybe i'm just a girl on a mission
but i'm ready to fly


i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
oh, i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
oh, i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world


oh, i'm just a girl
oh, i'm just a girl, oh, oh
oh, i'm just a girl~she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
she'll never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by


and you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
but you are everything to me


and i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
instead of just invisible


oh, yeah, oh


there's a fire inside of you
that can't help but shine through
she's never gonna see the light
no matter what you do


and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be


and i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
instead of just invisible


like shadows in a faded light
oh, we're invisible
i just wanna open your eyes
and make you realize


i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
baby, let me love you, let me want you
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
instead of just invisible

oh, yeah


she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile~she said i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky, the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said, $oh, my, my, my$


take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
you never did, you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids, you and i
oh, my, my, my, my


well, i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasn't that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we'd really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said, $oh, my, my, my$


take me back to the creek beds we turned up
$ am riding in your truck
and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside 'til the morning light
oh, my, my, my, my


a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me, got down on one knee


take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said, $i do,$ and i did, too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time, you and i


and i'll be eighty$seven, you'll be eighty$nine
i'll still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky, oh, my, my, my~i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a one$hand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around, turn the radio down
he says, $baby, is something wrong$$
i say, $nothin', i was just thinkin'
how we don't have a song$
and he says


our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date$ $man, i didn't kiss her, and i should have$
and when i got home, 'fore i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again


i was walking up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong or been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway, well on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice all the roses
and the note that said


our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date$ $man, i didn't kiss her, and i should have$
and when i got home, 'fore i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again


da$da$da$da


i've heard every album, listened to the radio
waited for somethin' to come along
that was as good as our song


'cause our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date$ $man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have$
and when i got home, 'fore i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again

play it again, oh, yeah
oh, oh, yeah


i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song~it's strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
yesterday, i found out about you
even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong


you say that you'd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes


you should've said no, you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd get back to me $get back to me$
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should've said no
baby, and you might still have me


you can see that i've been cryin'
and baby, you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same$


you say that the past is the past
you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes


you should've said no, you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd get back to me $get back to me$
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should've said no
baby, and you might still have me
oh, oh


i can't resist
before you go, tell me this
was it worth it$
was she worth this$
no, no
no, no, no, no

you should've said no, you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd get back to me $get back to me$
and i should've been there, in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should've said no
baby, and you might still have me~cory's eyes are like a jungle
he smiles, it's like the radio
he whispers songs into my window
in words that nobody knows
there's pretty girls on every corner
they watch him as he's walking home
saying, $does he know$$
will you ever know$


you're beautiful, every little piece, love
don't you know you're really gonna be someone$
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh, but if it don't
stay beautiful


cory finds another way to be
the highlight of my day
i'm taking pictures in my mind
so i can save 'em for a rainy day
it's hard to make a conversation
when he's taking my breath away
i should say, $hey, by the way$


you're beautiful, every little piece, love
don't you know you're really gonna be someone$
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh, but if it don't
stay beautiful


if you and i are a story
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream
i'll never get to hold, at least you'll know


you're beautiful, every little piece, love
don't you know you're really gonna be someone$
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my front door
oh, but if it don't
will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful$
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful


la$la$la
oh$oh$oh
oh$oh$oh$oh
oh, but if it don't
stay beautiful, stay beautiful
na$na$na, na$na~i didn't know what i would find
when i went looking for a reason, i know
i didn't read between the lines
and, baby, i've got nowhere to go


i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right$


so how can i ever try to be better$
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you, this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside


you saw me there, but never knew
that i would give it all up to be
a part of this, a part of you
and now, it's all too late, so you see


you could've helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until it's too late to do anything


how can i ever try to be better$
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you, this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside


oh, yeah


how can i ever try to be better$
nobody ever lets me in
and i can still see you, this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside


oh$oh
oh, oh$oh
oh$oh
oh$oh~he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said, $that's a lie$
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck
on backroads at night


and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone


but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me


september saw a month of tears
and thankin' god that you weren't here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back


it's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
and lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe


when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me


and i'm back for the first time since then
i'm standin' on your street
and there's a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that you'll read


is, $when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you'll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place$
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

oh, think of me, mmm
he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said, $that's a lie~i'm so glad you made time to see me
how's life$ tell me, how's your family$
i haven't seen them in a while
you've been good, busier than ever
we small talk, work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why


because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die


so, this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you sayin', $i'm sorry for that night$
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time


these days, i haven't been sleeping
stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
when your birthday passed and i didn't call
then i think about summer, all the beautiful times
i watched you laughin' from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall


and then the cold came, the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye


so, this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin', $i'm sorry for that night$
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time


i miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
so good to me, so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinkin'
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it, but i can't
so, if the chain is on your door, i understand


but this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin', $i'm sorry for that night$
and i go back to december
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and make it alright
i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time

all the time~now go stand in the corner and think about what you did $ha$
haha, time for a little revenge


the story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
i had it all, i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say $sabotage$
i never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with $oh$
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealin' from


she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
he was a moth to the flame
she was holding the matches, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge $revenge$, ha


she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever$present frown is a little troubling, and
she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
that no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
$think about what you did$


she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
he was a moth to the flame
she was holding the matches, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge $haha$


i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him, but haven't you heard$
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him, but i always get the last word
woah $come on, can you take it back$ come on$


she's not a saint and she's not what you think $no$
she's an actress, woah $you know that you deserve this$
he was a moth to the flame
she was holding the matches, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge

$come on$ do you still feel like you know what you're doin'$
'cause i don't think you do, oh $no, no, no, no$
do you still feel like you know what you're doing$ $no$
i don't think you do, i don't think you do
let's hear the applause $come on, come on$
come on, show me how much better you are $oh, oh$
$so much better, yeah$$
so you deserve some applause
'cause you're so much better
she took him faster than you could say $sabotage~$once, i had an empire$
$once, i had an empire$
$once, i had an empire$


once, i had an empire in a golden age
i was held up so high, i used to be great
they used to cheer when they saw my face
now, i fear i have fallen from grace


and i feel like my castle's crumbling down
and i watch all my bridges burn to the ground
and you don't want to know me, i will just let you down
you don't wanna know me now


once, i was the great hope for a dynasty
crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
their faith was strong, but i pushed it too far
i held that grudge 'til it tore me apart


power went to my head and i couldn't stop
ones i loved tried to help, so i ran them off
and here i sit alone behind walls of regret
falling down like promises that i never kept


and i feel like my castle's crumbling down
and i watch all my bridges burn to the ground
and you don't want to know me, i will just let you down
you don't wanna know me now


my foes and friends watch my reign end
i don't know how it could've ended this way
smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
people look at me like i'm a monster
now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
used to chant my name
now they're screaming that they hate me
never wanted you to hate me


my castle's crumbling down
and i watch all my bridges burn to the ground
and you don't want to know me, i will just let you down $just let you down$
my castle's crumbling down
you don't wanna know me now, now


$once, i had an empire$
$once, i had an empire$
$once, i had an empire$~long were the nights
when my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
prayin' the floor won't fall through again
and my mother accused me of losin' my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
then go back to turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you change the rules every day
wonderin' which version of you
i might get on the phone tonight
well, i stopped pickin' up
and this song is to let you know why


dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with$
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i shoulda known


well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love and take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
and i'll look back and regret how i ignored when they said
$run as fast as you can$


dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with$
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john, i see it all now, it was wrong
don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
your dark, twisted games when i loved you so$
i shoulda known




you are an expert at $sorry$ and keepin' lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'cause you burned them out
but i took your matches before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
oh


dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with$
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with$
the girl in the dress wrote you a song
you shoulda known

you shoulda known
don't you think i was too young$
you shoulda known~just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
i've got my money on things goin' badly
got a history of stories ending sadly
still hoping that the fire won't burn me
just one time, just one time


all i know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
and i want you now, wanna need you forever
in the heat of your electric touch, mmm


i've been left in the rain lost and pining
i'm tryin' hard not to look like i'm trying
'cause every time i tried hard for love, it fell apart $woah$
i've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
i've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
still, i know that all it takes is to get it right
just one time, just one time


all i know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
and i want you now, wanna need you forever
in the heat of your electric touch, mmm


i was thinking just one time $just one time$
maybe the stars align $just one time$
and maybe i call you mine
and you won't need space
or string me along while you decide
and just one time $just one time$
maybe the moment's right $the moment's right$
it's $$$$ and i see two headlights


all i know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
got a feelin' your electric touch $ooh$
all i know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life $life$
and i want you now, wanna need you forever
in the heat of your electric touch, mmm~there i was again tonight
forcing laughter, faking smiles
same old tired, lonely place
walls of insincerity
shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you


your eyes whispered, $have we met$$
across the room, your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you


this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll sp$nd forever wonderin' if you kn$w
i was enchanted to meet you


the lingering question kept me up
$am, who do you love$
i wonder 'til i'm wide awake
and now, i'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say
$hey, it was enchanting to meet you$
all i know is i was enchanted to meet you


this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you


this is me praying that
this was the very first page
not where the storyline ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you
please, don't be in love with someone else
please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
please, don't be in love with someone else $ooh$
please, don't have somebody waitin' on you $oh$oh$


this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
this night is flawless $please, don't be in love with someone else$
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck $please, don't have somebody waitin' on you$
dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever $please, don't be in love with someone else$
wonderin' if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you

please, don't be in love with someone else
please, don't have somebody waitin' on you~my cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
and chances are i will talk myself to sleep again
you give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
and i will block out these voices of reason in my head


and the voices say, $you are not the exception
you will never learn your lesson$


foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will take the long way, you will take the long way down


you know how to keep me waitin'
i know how to act like i'm fine
don't know what to call this situation
but i know i can't call you mine
and it's delicate, but i will do my best to seem bulletproof
'cause when my head is on your shoulder
it starts thinkin' you'll come around
and maybe, someday, when we're older
this is something we'll laugh about
over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news


but then the voices say, $you are not the exception
you will never learn your lesson$


foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will take the long way, you will take the long way down
foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out


now i'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
sayin', $how could i not see the signs$$
oh, you haven't written me or called
but goodbye screamin' in the silence
and the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
i'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
and you will say you had the best of intentions
and maybe i will finally learn my lesson


foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will take the long way, you will take the long way down
foolish one
stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
that ain't never gonna come
you will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh$oh, oh, oh

la$la$la$la$la, la$la$la$la, oh
la$la$la$la$la
ain't never gonna come
ooh, you will learn the hard way now
foolish one
sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
they ain't never gonna come
and thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
foolish one
the day is gonna come for your confessions of love
when all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
no, he just wasn't the one~you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought i'd live to see it break
it's getting dark and it's all so quiet
and i can't trust anything now
and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake


oh, holding my breath
won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted


stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time, i'm wishing he was you instead


oh, holding my breath
won't see you again
something keeps me holding onto nothing


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
i can't turn back now, i'm haunted


i know, i know
i just know
you're not gone
you can't be gone, no


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong $terribly wrong$
won't finish what you started
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
i can't go back, i'm haunted

oh
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break
never thought i'd see it~i$i$i$i


you brush past me in the hallway
and you don't think i, i, i can see ya, do ya$
i've been watchin' you for ages
and i spend my time tryin' not to feel it


but what would you do if i went to touch you now$
what would you do if they never found us out$
what would you do if we never made a sound$


'cause i can see you waitin' down the hall from me
and i could see you up against the wall with me
and what would you do$ baby, if you only knew
that i can see you


i$i$i$i


and we kept everything professional
but something's changed, it's somethin' i, i like
they keep watchful eyes on us
so it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
you won't believe half the things i see inside my head
wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet


but what would you do if i went to touch you now$
what would you do if they never found us out$
what would you do if we never made a sound$


'cause i can see you waitin' down the hall from me
and i could see you up against the wall with me
and what would you do$ baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
that i could see you throw your jacket on the floor
i could see you, make me want you even more
what would you do$ baby, if you only knew
that i can see you


i$i$i$i


i can see you in your suit and your necktie
passed me a note sayin', $meet me tonight$
then we kiss and you know i won't ever tell, yeah
and i could see you being my addiction
you can see me as a secret mission
hide away and i will start behaving myself


i$i$i$i
oh$oh, oh, oh

i can see you waitin' down the hall from me
and i could see you up against the wall with me
and what would you do$ baby, if you only knew, oh
that i could see you throw your jacket on the floor
i could see you, make me want you even more
what would you do$ baby, if you only knew
that i can see you, oh, i can see you


oh, i see you, i see you, baby
i see you
$i$i$i$i$ i see you, i see you, baby
oh, baby~i guess you really did it this time
left yourself in your war path
lost your balance on a tightrope
lost your mind tryin' to get it back


wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days$
always a bigger bed to crawl into
wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
and everybody believed in you$


it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
you're still an innocent


did some things you can't speak of
but at night, you live it all again
you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then


wasn't it easier in your firefly$catching days$
when everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down to you
wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you$


it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
thirty$two and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent


time turns flames to embers
you'll have new septembers
every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
minds change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new
oh, oh


it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
thirty$two and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent
you're still an innocent

lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
it's never too late to get it back~i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at $$$$
the words that you whispered for just us to know
you told me you loved me, so why did you go away$
away
i do recall now, the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement, i ran off the plane
that july ninth, the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt, i can still feel your arms


but now i'll go
sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be somethin' you miss


i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips


i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party, you're showin' off again
and i'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
i'm not much for dancin', but for you, i did
because i love your handshake meetin' my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you'd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions


and i'll go
sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be somethin' you miss


i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm


so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are


and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in the weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind


so i'll go
sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be somethin' you miss

i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips


just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last~i said, $remember this moment$
in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in stands went wild
we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew our lives
would never be the same
you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age


long live the walls we crash$d through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was scr$aming, $long live all the magic we made$
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered


i said, $remember this feeling$
i pass the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
wishin' for right now
we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town
and the cynics were outraged
screaming, $this is absurd$
'cause for a moment, a band of thieves
in ripped up jeans got to rule the world


long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming, $long live all the magic we made$
and bring on all the pretenders, i'm not afraid
long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
i was screaming, $long live that look on your face$
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered


hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall
will you take a moment$ promise me this
that you'll stand by me forever
but if, god forbid, fate should step in
and force us into a goodbye
if you have children some day
when they point to the pictures
please, tell 'em my name
tell 'em how the crowds went wild
tell 'em how i hope they shine
long live the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life with you

long, long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
and i was screaming, $long live all the magic we made$
and bring on all the pretenders, i'm not afraid
singing, $long live all the mountains we moved$
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
and long, long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered~you, with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feelin' like a nothing
you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i'm wounded
you, pickin' on the weaker man


well, you can take me down
with just one single blow
but you don't know what you don't know


someday, i'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean$


you, with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i don't already see them
i walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again


i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
'cause you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know what you don't know


someday, i'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean$


and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big, loud opinion, but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same ole bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing
but all you are is mean


all you are is mean
and a liar, and pathetic
and alone in life, and mean
and mean, and mean, and mean

but someday, i'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean$
someday, i'll be livin' in a big ole city
$why you gotta be so mean$$
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
$why you gotta be so mean$$
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
$why you gotta be so mean$$
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean$~ah$ah, ah$ah
ah$ah, ah$ah


you were in college working part$time, waiting tables
left a small town, never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts


i say, $can you believe it$$
as we're lying on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes, yes, i can see it now


do you remember, we were sitting there by the water$
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine


flash forward and we're taking on the world together
and there's a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded
you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes, yes, this is what i thought about


do you remember, we were sitting there by the water$
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water$
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine


oh$oh, oh


and i remember that fight, $$$$ am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
'cause it's all i've ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said, $i'll never leave you alone$ $oh$

you said, $i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you, it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine$


hold on, make it last
hold on, never turn back
$hold on$ you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
$hold on$ you are the best thing that's ever been mine


do you believe it$ $yeah, yeah, yeah$
we're gonna make it now $yeah, yeah, yeah$
and i can see it $yeah, yeah$
i can see it now~your little hand's wrapped around my finger
and it's so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
so i tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight


to you, everything's funny
you got nothing to regret
i'd give all i have, honey
if you could stay like that


oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you
won't let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up


and never grow up


you're in the car, on the way to the movies
and you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
at fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots


but don't make her drop you off around the block
remember that she's gettin' older, too
and don't lose the way that you dance around
in your pjs getting ready for school


oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
and no one's ever burned you
nothing's ever left you scarred
and even though you want to
just try to never grow up


take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps, remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is, someday, gonna be gone


so, here i am in my new apartment
in a big city, they just dropped me off
it's so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

wish i'd never grown up
wish i'd never grown up
oh, i don't wanna grow up
wish i'd never grown up, i could still be little
oh, i don't wanna grow up
wish i'd never grown up, it could still be simple
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you $never grow up$
won't let no one break your heart
and even though you want to
please, try to never grow up


oh, oh $never grow up$
just never grow up
oh $never grow up$
just never grow up~elevator buttons and morning air
strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
if you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
but right now, my time is theirs
seems like there's always someone who disapproves
they'll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jury's out, but my choice is you


so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours


you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
and you'll say


don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours


and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours


so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they can't take what's ours
they can't take what's ours
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours~the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and i'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
but i kinda know that i won't get far
and you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see what i was thinkin' of


drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile


my mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really somethin'
you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be
i'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you, i know it's no good
and i could wait patiently, but i really wish you would


drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile


i'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow$
i'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show


drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk $ah$ah$, take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile


and the sparks fly
oh, baby, smile
and the sparks fly~i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry


this is surely not what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say


don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said, $sp$ak now$


fond gestures are $xchanged
and the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bride$to$be


she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me, don't you$


don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said, $speak now$
don't say yes, run away now $run away now$
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow $say a single vow$
your time is running out
and they said, $speak now$


ooh $run away now$, la
ooh $say a single vow$, ooh


i hear the preacher say
$speak now or forever hold your peace$
there's the silence, there's my last chance
i stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but i'm only lookin' at you

i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha


so, don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
they said, $speak now$
and you say, $let's run away now $run away now$
i'll meet you when i'm out
of my tux, at the back door
baby, i didn't say my vows $say a single vow$
so glad you were around
when they said, 'speak now'~tall, dark, and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
it's the same thing to me
he's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say
and you smile and say, $how are you$$
and i'll say, $just fine$
i always forget to tell you, $i love you$
i love you forever


i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
and i watch superman fly away
come back, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down


tall, dark and beautiful
he's complicated, he's irrational
but i hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
he's not all bad like his reputation
and i can't hear one single word they say
and you'll leave, got places to be, and i'll be okay
i always forget to tell you, $i love you$
i loved you from the very first day


i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
and i watch superman fly away
come back, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down


and i watch you fly around the world
and i hope you don't save some other girl
don't forget, don't forget about me
i'm far away, but i never let you go
i'm love$struck and looking out the window
don't forget, don't forget where i'll be


right here, wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the call was from you
'cause i loved you from the very first day


i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
forever and ever
and i watch superman fly away
i swear, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down

la, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la
when you come back down~i used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
how we met and the sparks flew instantly
and people would say, $they're the lucky ones$
i used to know my place was the spot next to you
now i'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on


oh, a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fallout
so many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up, i can't break through


now i'm standin' alone in a crowded room
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
like it's killin' me$ yeah
i don't know what to say since th$ twist of fate
when it all broke down
and th$ story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


next chapter


how'd we end up this way$
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy
and you're doin' your best to avoid me
i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us
how i was losin' my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride like you should've held me


oh, i'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothin'$
i'd tell you i miss you, but i don't know how
i've never heard silence quite this loud


now i'm standin' alone in a crowded room
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
like it's killin' me$ yeah
i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


this is looking like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but i liked it better when you were on my side
the battle's in your hands now
but i would lay my armor down
if you said you'd rather love than fight

so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon


now i'm standin' alone in a crowded room
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
like it's killin' me$ yeah
and i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
like it's killin' me$ yeah
i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'cause we're goin' down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


the end~down the block, there's an antique shop
and something in my head said, $stop,$ so i walked in
on the counter was a cardboard box
and the sign said, $photos$ twenty$five cents each$
black and white, saw a $$s bride
and school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
the kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
the kind you don't put down


and that's when i called you and it's so hard to explain
but in those photos, i saw us instead
and, somehow, i know that you and i would've found each other
in another life, you still would've turned my head even if w$'d met


on a crowded street in $$$$
and you wer$ headed off to fight in the war
you still would've been mine
we would have been timeless
i would've read your love letters every single night
and prayed to god you'd be comin' home all right
and you would've been fine
we would have been timeless
'cause i believe that we were supposed to find this
so, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
we would've been timeless


i had to smile when it caught my eye
there was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
holdin' hands on the way to a dance
and the date on the back said $$$$
which brought me back to the first time i saw you
time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
i thought about it as i started lookin' 'round
at these precious things that time forgot


that's when i came upon a book covered in cobwebs
story of a romance torn apart by fate
hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
and i'd die for you in the same way if i first saw your face


in the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
and i was forced to marry another man
you still would've been mine
we would have been timeless
i would've read your love letters every single night
and run away and left it all behind
you still would've been mine
we would've been timeless
'cause i believe that we were supposed to find this
so, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
we would've been timeless

time breaks down your mind and body
don't you let it touch your soul
it was like an age$old classic
the first time that you saw me
the story started when you said, $hello$


in a crowded room a few short years ago
and sometimes there's no proof, you just know
you're always gonna be mine
we're gonna be
i'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
we'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
and you'll say, $oh my, we really were timeless$


we're gonna be timeless, timeless
you still would've been mine
we would've been
even if we'd met on a crowded street in $$$$
you still would've been mine
we would've been


down the block, there's an antique shop
and somethin' in my head said, $stop,$ so i walked in~when emma falls in love, she paces the floor
closes the blinds and locks the door
when emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
she waits and takes her time
'cause little miss sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
when emma falls in love, i know
that boy will never be the same


'cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
like if cleopatra grew up in a small town
and all the bad boys would be good boys
if they only had a chance to love her
and to tell you the truth, sometimes i wish i was her


when emma falls in love, it's all on her face
hangs in the air like stars in outer space
when emma falls in love, she disappears
and we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
when emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
she takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'cause when emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
she won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave


and she's the kind of book that you can't put down
like if cleopatra grew up in a small town
and all the bad boys would be good boys
if they only had a chance to love her
and to tell you the truth, sometimes i wish i was her


well, she's so new york when she's in l$a$  
she won't lose herself in love the way that i did
'cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
when emma falls in love, i'm learning


emma met a boy with eyes like a man
turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
now he'll be her shelter when it rains
little does he know, his whole world's about to change


'cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
like if cleopatra grew up in a small town
and all the bad boys would be good boys
if they only had a chance to love her
and to tell you the truth, sometimes i wish i was her

yeah, between me and you, sometimes i wish i was her~'cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
you know it used to be mad love $uh$
so take a look what you've done $uh$
'cause, baby, now we've got bad blood $uh$, hey $hey$

my tlc was quite od, id my facts $id my$
now pov of you and me, similar iraq
i don't hate you, but i hate to critique, overrate you
these beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
take time and erase you, love don't hear no more, no, i don't fear no more
better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more


oh, it's so sad to
think about the good times

'cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
people are people and sometimes we change our minds
but it's killing me to see you go after all this time


mm$mm, mm$mm$mm$mm
mm$mm, mm$mm$mm$mm


the music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
it's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
now i don't know what to be without you around


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand


and i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to


never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
every little bump in the road, i tried to swerve
but people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
and nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand


and i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to


it's $ a$m$, feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
it's $ a$m$, feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh


i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to


i'm sorry, i'm sorry $mmm$
i'm sorry, $yeah, yeah$ i'm sorry
i'm sorry, i'm sorry $ooh, ooh$
i'm sorry~it wasn't just like a movie
the rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
i'm drivin' away and i, i guess you could say
this is the last time i'll drive this way again
lost in the gray and i try to grab at the fray
'cause i, i still love you, but i can't


bye, bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
bye, bye, baby
bye, bye, baby


the picture frame is empty
on the dresser, vacant just like me
i see your writing on the dash
then back to your hesitation
i was so sure of everything
everything i thought we'd always have
guess i never doubted it
then the here and the now floods in
feels like i'm becoming a part of your past


bye, bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
bye, bye, baby


and there's so much that i can't touch
you're all i want, but it's not enough this time
and all the pages are just slipping through my hands
and i'm so scared of how this ends


bye, bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me


bye, bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
oh, you took me home, i thought you were gonna keep me
bye, bye, baby
bye, bye, baby~well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know it's all the same, another time and place
repeating history and you're getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and i'll do anything to see it through


because these things will change
can you feel it now$
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
and we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
oh, oh


so we've been outnumbered, raid$d, and now cornered
it's hard to fight when th$ fight ain't fair
we're getting stronger now, find things they never found
they might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
you can walk away, say we don't need this
but there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'cause these things will change
can you feel it now$
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
and we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
oh, oh


tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
fight for what we've worked for all these years
and the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
but we'll stand up champions tonight


it was the night things changed
can you see it now$
when the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
it's a revolution, throw your hands up
'cause we never gave in
and we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
hallelujah~i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna go there anymore
and i know all the steps up to your door
but i don't wanna go there anymore


talk to the wind, talk to the sky
talk to the man with the reasons why
and let me know what you find


i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night to call your name
just know i'm right here hoping
that you'll come in with the rain


i could stand up and sing you a song
but i don't wanna have to go that far
and i, i've got you down, i know you by heart
and you don't even know where i start


talk to yourself, talk to the tears
talk to the man who put you here
and don't wait for the sky to clear


i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night to call your name, oh
just know i'm right here hoping
that you'll come in with the rain


i've watched you so long, screamed your name
i don't know what else i can say


i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night for all these games
just know i'm right here hoping
that you'll come in with the rain


i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna go there anymore~hey, i knew i'd run into you somewhere
it's been a while, i didn't mean to stare
i heard she's nothin' like me
i'm sure she'll make you happy


but don't you, don't you
smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you say you've
missed me if you don't want me again
you don't know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you, don't you$


ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah


sometimes, i really wish that i could hate you
i've tried, but that's just somethin' i can't do
my heart knows what the truth is
i swore i wouldn't do this


but don't you, don't you
smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you say you've
missed me if you don't want me again
you don't know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you, don't you$


so i'll walk out of here tonight
try to go on with my life
and you can say we're still friends
$but i don't wanna pretend$
so if i see you again


don't you $don't you$, don't you
smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you $don't you$ say you've
missed me if you don't want me again
you don't $you don't$ know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you, don't you$


ah, ah, ah, ah
don't you $ah, ah, ah$~there's something 'bout the way
the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot, yeah
oh, yeah


we're driving down the road, i wonder if you know
i'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
absent$mindedly making me want you


and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, f$arless


so, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this on$$horse town
i wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now, capture it, remember it


'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless
oh, oh


well, you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake, i'm not usually this way but
you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
it's fearless
oh, yeah


'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless


oh, oh
oh$oh, yeah~you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the mornin' of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
$you know, i haven't seen you around before$


'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
well, count to ten, take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
at fifteen


you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough, you're best friends
laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be outta here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feelin' like flyin'
and your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
and you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends


'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin around, well
in your life you'll do things greater than
datin' the boy on the football team
i didn't know it at fifteen


when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then, i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had
to a boy who changed his mind
and we both cried


'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
but i've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen

la$la$la, la$la$la, la$la$la$la
la$la$la, la$la$la, la$la$la$la
la$la$la, la$la$la


your very first day
take a deep breath, girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors~once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding$
'cause it seems to me
this thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby, what happened$ please tell me
'cause one second it was perfect
now you're halfway out the door


and i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said, $forever and always$
oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, $forever and always$


was i out of line$
did i say something way too honest, made you run and hide
like a scared little boy$
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute, now i'm not so sure
so here's to everything coming down to nothing
here's to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going$
thought i knew for a minute, but i don't anymore


and i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said, $forever and always$
oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, $forever and always$
you didn't mean it baby, i don't think so


oh, back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything$
back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything$


'cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, $forever and always$
oh, i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said, $forever and always$
and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, $forever and always$

you didn't mean it baby
you said, $forever and always,$ yeah~mmm$mm, mm$mm
mmm$mm, mm$mm
mmm$mm, mm$mm, yeah

i'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
and pull me near and shine, shine, shine

why i should be the one you choose
all those other girls, well, they're beautiful
but would they write a song for you$ $ha$ha$ha$


i can't help it if you look like an angel

we're on the phone and without a warnin'
i realize your laugh is the best sound
i have ever heard
i like the way i can't keep my focus
i watch you talk, you didn't notice
i hear the words, but all i can think is
$we should be together$


every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i'll shine for you


woah$oh, i'm feelin' you, baby
don't be afraid to jump, then fall
jump, then fall into me
baby, i'm never gonna leave you
say that you wanna be with me too
'cause i'ma stay through it all
so, jump, then fall


huh, well, i like the way your hair falls in your face
you got the keys to me, i love each freckle on your face, oh
i've never been so wrapped up, honey
i like the way you're everything i ever wanted
i had time to think it oh$over
and all i can say is, $come closer$
take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me


'cause every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i'll shine for you


woah$oh, i'm feelin' you, baby

'cause i'ma stay through it all
so, jump, then fall


the bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
i'll catch you, i'll catch you
when people say things that bring you to your knees
i'll catch you
the time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
but i'll hold you through the night until you smile


woah$oh, i need you, baby

and every time you're here
baby, i'll show you, i'll show you
you can jump, then fall, jump, then fall
jump, then fall into me, into me, yeah~we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say, $hello$
little did i know


that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said, $stay away from juliet$
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, $please don't go,$ and i said


romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, $yes$


so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'cause you were romeo, i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said, $stay away from juliet$
but you were everything to me
i was begging you, $please don't go,$ and i said


romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, $yes$
romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult, but it's real
don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story, baby, just say, $yes$


oh, oh


but i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town


and i said, $romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you, but you never come
is this in my head$ i don't know what to think$
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
$marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
it's a love story, baby, just say, 'yes'$

oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
'cause we were both young when i first saw you~mr$ $perfect face$
mr$ $here to stay$
mr$ $looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away$
everything was right
mr$ $i've been waitin' for you all my life$
mr$ $every single day until the end, i will be by your side$


but that was when i got to know mr$ $change of heart$
mr$ $leaves me all alone,$ i fall apart
it takes everything in me just to get up each day
but it's wonderful to see that you're okay


hello, mr$ $perfectly fine$
how's your heart after breakin' mine$
mr$ $always at the right place at the right time,$ baby
hello, mr$ $casually cruel$
mr$ $everything revolves around you$
i've been miss misery since your goodbye
and you're mr$ $perfectly fine$


mr$ $never told me why$
mr$ $never had to see me cry$
mr$ $insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy$
he goes about his day
forgets he ever even heard my name
well, i thought you might be different than the rest, i guess you're all the same


'cause i hear he's got his arm 'round a brand$new girl
i've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
and i never got past what you put me through
but it's wonderful to see that it never phased you


hello, mr$ $perfectly fine$
how's your heart after breakin' mine$
mr$ $always at the right place at the right time,$ baby
hello, mr$ $casually cruel$
mr$ $everything revolves around you$
i've been miss misery since your goodbye
and you're mr$ $perfectly fine$


so dignified in your well$pressed suit
so strategized, all the eyes on you
sashay your way to your seat
it's the best seat, in the best room
oh, he's so smug, mr$ $always wins$
so far above me in every sense
so far above feeling anything


and it's really such a shame
it's such a shame
'cause i was miss $here to stay$
now i'm miss $gonna be alright someday$
and someday maybe you'll miss me
but by then, you'll be mr$ $too late$

goodbye, mr$ $perfectly fine$
how's your heart after breakin' mine$
mr$ $always at the right place at the right time,$ baby
goodbye, mr$ $casually cruel$
mr$ $everything revolves around you$
i've been miss misery for the last time
and you're mr$ $perfectly fine$


you're perfectly fine
mr$ $looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away$
you said you'd never go away~this is wrong but i can't help but feel like
there ain't nothing more right, babe
misty morning comes again and i can't
help but wish i could see your face
i knew from the first note played
i'd be breaking all my rules to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
scream your name


so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
$i can't keep my eyes off of you$
i'm no one special, just another wide$eyed girl
who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph
to hang on my wall, superstar


morning lonelin$ss comes around when i'm not
dreaming about you
wh$n my world wakes up today
you'll be in another town
and i knew when i saw your face
i'd be counting down the ways to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
scream your name


so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
$i can't take my eyes off of you$
i'm no one special, just another wide$eyed girl
who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph
to hang on my wall, superstar


you played in bars, you play guitar
i'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
and you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
every night from the radio


so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
$i can't take my eyes off of you$
i'm no one special, just another wide$eyed girl
who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph
to hang on my wall, superstar


sweet, sweet superstar
superstar~i took a chance, i took a shot
and you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not
you took a swing, i took it hard
and down here from the ground, i see who you are


i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me, then cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why


well, you could write a book on
how to ruin someone's perf$ct day
well, i get so confused and frustrat$d
forget what i'm tryin' to say, oh


i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me, then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why


why do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside$
why do you have to put down my dreams
so you're the only thing on my mind$


well, i'm sick and tired of your attitude
feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me and cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i've got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love, then you push me around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why, why
tell me why, oh


i take a step back, i let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof
now you know~you said, $i know$
when i said, $i need some time, need some space
to think about all of this$
and you watched me go
and i knew my words were hard to hear
and harder to ever take back


and i said, $when can i$i$i come back$$


and you said, $that's when
when i wake up in the morning
that's when, when it's sunny or storming
laughing, when i'm crying
and that's when i'll be waiting at the front gate
that's when, when i see your face
i'll let you in, and baby, that's when$
mm, mm


i said, $i know$
when you said, $i did you wrong, made mistakes
and put you through all of this$ $through all of this$
then through the phone
came all your tears
and i said, $leave those all in our past$


and you said, $when can i$i$i come back$$


and i said, $that's when
when i wake up in the morning
that's when, when it's sunny or storming
laughing, when i'm crying
and that's when i'll be waiting at the front gate
that's when, when i see your face
i'll let you in, and baby, that's when$


and you said, $honestly
when you were gone
did you ever think of me$$
and i said


$that's when, when i woke up in the morning
that's when it was sunny or storming
laughing, when i was crying
and that's when you were waiting at the front gate
that's when, when i saw your face
you let me in, and baby, that's when$

that's when, when i wake up in the morning $yeah$
that's when, when it's sunny or storming
when i'm laughing, when i'm crying
$that's when i'll be waiting at the front gate$
that's when i miss you, that's when i want you
$that's when, when i see your face$
that's when i love you, that's when~i'm five years old, it's getting cold, i've got my big coat on
i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, i run and run
past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
look now, the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
but i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today


i'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
and we talk and window shop 'til i've forgotten all their names


i don't know who i'm gonna talk to now at school
but i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day with you today


i have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother
inside and out, he's better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run and i
had the best days with you


there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
it's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world


now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
for staying back and watching me shine
and i didn't know if you knew
so i'm taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you today~in the heat of the fight i walked away
ignorin' words that you were sayin'
tryna make me stay
i said, $this time i've had enough$
and you've called a hundred times
but i'm not picking up


'cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over
but if you look a little closer


i said, $leave,$ but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
screamin', $i'm in love with you$
wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door


me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
i keep goin' back over things we both said
and i remember the slamming door
and all the things that i misread


oh, babe, if you know everything
tell me why you couldn't see
when i left, i wanted you to chase after me, yeah


i said, $leave,$ but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
screamin', $i'm in love with you$
wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door


and i'll scream out the window
i can't even look at you
i don't need you but i do, i do, i do
i say, $there's nothing you can say
to make this right again, i mean it, i mean it$
but what i mean is


i said, $leave,$ but, baby, all i want is you
to stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
screamin', $i'm in love with you$
wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

with your face and the beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carried me from your car up the stairs
and i broke down crying, was she worth this mess$
after everything and that little black dress
after everything i must confess, i need you~he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear
and it's like i couldn't ask for anything better
he opens up my door, and i get into his car
and he says, $you look beautiful tonight$
and i feel perfectly fine


but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's $am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you


he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
he's close to my mother
talks business with my father
he's charming and endearing
and i'm comfortable


but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's $am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you


he can't see the smile i'm faking
and my heart's not breaking
'cause i'm not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating
intoxicating, complicated
got away by some mistake, and now


i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
it's $am and i'm cursing your name
so in love that i acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you oh, oh

woah, woah, oh$oh, oh
and that's the way i loved you, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, woah
never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you~today was a fairytale, you were the prince
i used to be a damsel in distress
you took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale


today was a fairytale, i wore a dress
you wore a dark gray t$shirt
you told me i was pretty when i looked like a mess
today was a fairytale


time slows down
whenever you're around


well, can you feel this magic in the air$
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale

today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
that takes me to another planet
every move you make, everything you say is right
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale, all that i can say
is now it's getting so much clearer
nothing made sense 'til the time i saw your face
today was a fairytale


time slows down

oh, oh, yeah, oh
today was a fairytale~untouchable like a distant diamond sky
i'm reaching out and i just can't tell you why
i'm caught up in you, i'm caught up in you


untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
and when you're close, i feel like coming undone


in the middle of the night, when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars spelling out your name
you got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
come on, come on, little taste of heaven
oh, oh


it's half full and i won't wait here all day
i know you're saying that you'd be here anyway


but you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
and now that you're close, i feel like coming undone


in the middle of the night, when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars spelling out your name
you got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
come on, come on, oh
in the middle of the night, waking from this dream
i want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
you got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
come on, come on, little taste of heaven


i'm caught up in you
oh$oh, oh, oh$oh
but you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
now that you're close, i feel like coming undone


in the middle of the night, when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars spelling out your name
you got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
come on, come on, oh, oh$oh

it's like a million little stars spelling out your name
they're spelling out your name, oh~we used to walk along the streets
when the porch lights were shining bright
before i had somewhere to be
back when we had all night and we were happy
i do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
you threw your arms around my neck, back when i deserved it
and we were happy


when it was good, baby, it was good, baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy


we used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
that's sorta how i feel right now
and goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy


when it was good, baby, it was good, baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy
we were happy


oh, i hate those voices telling me i'm not in love anymore
but they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'cause we were happy
we were happy


when it was good, baby, it was good, baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm
and you were gonna marry me
and we were happy
we were happy
oh$oh$oh$oh
we were happy~say you're sorry, that face of an angel
comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time
'cause i honestly believed in you


holdin' on, the days drag on
stupid girl, i shoulda known, i shoulda known


that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to come around


maybe i was naive, got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
well, my mistak$, i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have th$ upper hand


i had so many dreams about you and me
happy endings, well now i know


that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to come around


and there you are on your knees
beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
just like i always wanted
but i'm so sorry


'cause i'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
i'm gonna find someone someday
who might actually treat me well
this is a big world, that was a small town
there in my rearview mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to catch me now


oh, woah, woah, woah
try and catch me now, oh
it's too late to catch me now~once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
shouldn't i find a stain$ but i never do
the way the tires turn stones on old county roads
they leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
you find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
but like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
you can't change where it's been, reminds me of me


i lived and i learned
had you, got burned
held out and held on
god knows, too long, and wasted time
lost tears, swore that i'd get out of here
but no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me


the best and worst day of june
was the one that i met you
with your hands in your pockets
and your $don't you wish you had me$$ grin
well i did, so i smiled, and i melted like a child
now, every breath of air i breathe reminds me of then


and i lived and i learned
had you, got burned
held out and held on
god knows, too long, and wasted time
lost tears, swore that i'd get out of here
but no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me




i lived and i learned
and found out what it was to turn around
and see that we
were never really meant to be
so i lied, and i cried
and i watched a part of myself die
'cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me


i've still got you all over me
still got you all over me~you're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do
i'm in my room, it's a typical tuesday night
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
and she'll never know your story like i do


'cause she wears short skirts, i wear t$shirts
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time


if you could see that i'm the on$ who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you see$
you b$long with me, you belong with me


walking the streets with you and your worn$out jeans
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
hey, isn't this easy$
and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say you're fine, i know you better than that
hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that$


she wears high heels, i wear sneakers
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time


if you could see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you see$
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know, baby$
you belong with me, you belong with me


oh, i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry
i know your favorite songs
and you tell me 'bout your dreams
think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me


can't you see that i'm the one who understands you$
been here all along, so why can't you see$
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know, baby$
you belong with me, you belong with me

you belong with me
have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me$
you belong with me~all this time i was wasting hoping you would come around
i've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
and it's taken me this long, baby, but i've figured you out
and you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around


you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry
no, no, oh$oh


you're looking so innocent, i might believe you if i didn't know
could've loved you all my life if you hadn't l$ft me waiting in the cold
and you've got your shar$ of secrets
and i'm tired of being last to know, oh
and now you're asking me to listen
'cause it's worked each time before


but you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry
no, no, oh$oh
you're not sorry
no, no, oh$oh


you had me crawling for you, honey
and it never would've gone away, no
you used to shine so bright, but i watched all of it fade


so you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
there's nothing left to beg for
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry
no, no, oh$oh
you're not sorry
no, no, oh$oh


no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no~my castle crumbled overnight

it was the best of times, the worst of crimes
i struck a match and blew your mind
but i didn't mean it and you didn't see it
the ties were black, the lies were white
in shades of gray in candlelight
i wanted to leave him, i needed a reason


$x$ marks the spot where we fell apart
he poisoned the well, i was lyin' to myself
i knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
we never had a shotgun shot in the dark $oh$$


you were drivin' the getaway car
we were flyin', but we'd never get far
don't pretend it's such a mystery
think about the place where you first met me
ridin' in a getaway car

should've known i'd be the first to leave
think about the place where you first met me


in a getaway car $oh$oh$oh$

it was the great escape, the prison break
the light of freedom on my face
but you weren't thinkin' and i was just drinkin'
while he was runnin' after us, i was screamin', $go, go, go$$
but with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
and a circus ain't a love story and now we're both sorry
$we're both sorry$


$x$ marks the spot where we fell apart
he poisoned the well, every man for himself
i knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed

gold cage, hostage to my feelings
back against the wall
trippin', trip$trippin' when you're gone


'cause we break down a little
but when you get me alone, it's so simple
'cause, baby, i know what you know
we can feel it

do bad things with you
so it goes


met you in a bar
all eyes on me, your illusionist
all eyes on us

jump into the pool from the balcony
everyone swimming in a champagne sea
and there are no rules when you show up here
bass beat rattling the chandelier
feeling so gatsby for that whole year


so why'd you have to rain on my parade$
i'm shaking my head and locking the gates

this is why we can't have nice things, darling
because you break them, i had to take them away
this is why we can't have nice things, honey $oh$
did you think i wouldn't hear all the things you said about me$
this is why we can't have nice things


it was so nice being friends again
there i was, giving you a second chance
but you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
and therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
get you on the phone and mind$twist you
and so i took an axe to a mended fence


but i'm not the only friend you've lost lately $mm$mm$
if only you weren't so shady

this is why we can't have nice things, darling $yeah$

i've been doing fine without you, really
up until the nights got cold

seems like everyone's got someone to hold


but for me it's just a lonely time
'cause there were christmases when you were mine

i'll bet you got your mom another sweater
and were your cousins late again$
when you were putting up the lights this year

i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when i didn't wonder how you are tonight

this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special


once bitten and twice shied
i keep my distance but you still catch my eye
tell me baby
do you recognize me
well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
merry christmas, i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying 'i love you', i meant it
now i know what a fool i've been
but if you kiss me now, i know you would fool me again


last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special


a crowded room and friends with tired eyes
i am hiding from you and your soul of ice
my god, i thought you were someone to rely on
me, i guess i was a shoulder to cry on
a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a girl on a cover but you tore her apart
maybe this year
maybe this year i will give it to someone special


because last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special

where the tree tops glisten and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow


i'm dreaming of a white christmas
with every christmas card i write
may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white




i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
so may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white


may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white~you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take, you take the very best of me
so i start a fight 'cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want 'cause i'm not what you wanted


oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day
just walk away, ain't no use defending
words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you


you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
and i stood there loving you and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you


oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day
so just walk away, ain't no use defending
words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you


you never did give a damn thing, honey
but i cried, cried for you
and i know you wouldn't have told nobody
if i died, died for you, died for you


oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day, oh
every smile you fake is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you
ooh$oh~friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes, we don't say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side


and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you


i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half, i'm only tryin' to
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you


just a small$town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world
tryna figure out what is and isn't true
and i don't try to hide my tears
my secrets or my deepest fears
through it all, nobody gets me like you do


and you know everything about me
you say that you can't live without me


i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half, i'm only tryin' to
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you


when i'm with anybody else
it's so hard to be myself
and only you can tell


that i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half, i'm only tryin' to
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me
who i wanna be
well, i'm only me when i'm with you

with you
uh$huh$huh, yeah~state the obvious, i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy
that's fine, you won't mind if i say
by the way


i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


there's no time for tears, i'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
there's nothing stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
and if you come around sayin' sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be


'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


and if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'cause coming back around here would be bad for your health


'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard
i really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
you're just another picture to burn
baby, burn~drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing
everything that we should be


i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without


drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's just so funny
that i can't even see
anyone when he's with me


he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night


he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do


drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe$
and there he goes, so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be


she'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause


he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do


so i'll drive home alone as i turn off the light
i'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight


'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do


he's the time taken up, but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into
drew looks at me
i fake a smile, so he won't see~seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking you're not pretty
but that's not true
'cause i know you


hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry, but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone, oh


i guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket $pocket$
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
it's not his price to pay


hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry, but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone, oh
oh, oh


hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone, oh


you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone, oh, oh$oh
goodbye, baby
with a smile, baby, baby
oh~everybody's waitin'
everybody's watchin'
even when you're sleepin'
keep your eyes open


the tricky thing
is yesterday, we were just children
playing soldiers, just pretending
dreaming dreams with happy endings
in backyards
winning battles with our wooden swords
but now we've stepped into a cruel world
where everybody stands and keeps score


$keep your eyes open$


everybody's waitin' for you to break down
everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
keep your eyes open


keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open


so here you are
two steps ahead and stayin' on guard
every lesson forms a new scar
they never thought you'd make it this far
but turn around $turn around$
oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown $showdown$
and nobody comes to save you now
but you got somethin' they don't
yeah, you got somethin' they don't


you just gotta keep your eyes open


everybody's waitin' for you to break down
everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
keep your eyes open


keep your eyes open
keep your eyes

keep your eyes open
keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
keep your eyes open

and i bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
you're trying not to think about what went wrong
trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
you're trying to stay awake so i bet you turn on the radio
and the song goes


i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby, oh, baby


the highway won't hold you tonight
the highway don't know you're alive
the highway don't care if you're all alone
but i do, i do
the highway won't dry your tears
the highway don't need you here
the highway don't care if you're coming home
but i do, i do


i bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
yeah, i bet you're bending god's ear talking 'bout me
you're trying not to let the first tear fall out
you're trying not to think about turning around
you're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
so you sing along


i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby, oh baby


the highway won't hold you tonight

but i do, i do

i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby~i washed my hands of us at the club
you made a mess of me
i pictured you with other girls in love
then threw up on the street
like waiting for a bus that never shows
you just start walkin' on
they say that if it's right, you know
each bar plays our song
nothing has ever felt so wrong


oh, my, love is a lie
shit my friends say to get me by
it hits different
it hits different this time
catastrophic blues
movin' on was always easy for me to do
it hits different
it hits different 'cause it's you


$'cause it's you$


i used to switch out these kens, i'd just ghost
rip the band$aid off and skip town lik$ an asshole outlaw
freedom felt like summ$r then on the coast
now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
and i never don't cry $and i never don't cry$ at the bar
yeah, my sadness is contagious $my sadness is contagious$
i slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
i stopped receiving invitations


oh, my, love is a lie
shit my friends say to get me by
it hits different
it hits different this time
catastrophic blues
movin' on was always easy for me to do
it hits different
it hits different 'cause it's you


$'cause it's you$


i find the artifacts, cried over a hat
cursed the space that i needed
i trace the evidence, make it make some sense
why the wound is still bleedin'
you were the one that i loved
don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
a wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
this is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
in the good in the world, you once believed in me
and i felt you and i held you for a while
bet i could still melt your world
argumentative, antithetical dream girl

i heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
is that your key in the door$
is it okay$ is it you$
or have they come to take me away$
to take me away


oh, my, love is a lie
shit my friends say to get me by
it hits different $it hits different$
it hits different this time
catastrophic blues
movin' on was always easy for me to do
it hits different $it hits different$
it hits different 'cause it's you


oh, my, love is a lie
shit my friends say to get me by
'cause it's you
catastrophic blues
movin' on was always easy for me to do
it hits different $yeah$
it hits different 'cause it's you~been sittin' eyes wide open
behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
it's just a cruel existence
like there's no point hopin' at all


baby, baby, i feel crazy
up all night, all night and every day
give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
what is happening to me$


i don't wanna live forever
'cause i know i'll be living in vain
and i don't wanna fit wherever
i just wanna keep calling your name
until you come back home
i just wanna keep calling your name
until you come back home
i just wanna keep calling your name
until you come back home


i'm sittin' eyes wide open
and i got one thing stuck in my mind
wonderin' if i dodged a bullet
or just lost the love of my life, oh
you might also like
baby, baby, i feel crazy
up all night, all night and every day
i gave you somethin', but you gave me nothin'

i just wanna keep calling your name
until you come back home


i've been looking sad in all the nicest places
baby, baby, i feel crazy

up all night, all night and every day
i've been looking sad in all the nicest places
give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
now i'm in a cab, i tell 'em where your place is
what is happening to me$

i just wanna keep calling your name
until you come back home


i just wanna keep callin' your name
until you come back home
until you come back home~last night, i heard my own heart beatin'
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and i'm still reachin'
even though i know you're not there
i was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
maybe i've been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you


come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'cause nothing like this ever happened to them
now i'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me
nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
back before i knew how much i had to lose


come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


if you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
i've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
i just want it back the way it was before
and i just wanna see you back at my front door


and i say, $come back, come back, come back to me like
you would before you said it's not that easy
before the fight, before i locked you out$
but i take it all back now


come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

you'd be here by now
it's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
baby, what about the ending$
oh, i thought that you'd be here by now
oh, oh
thought you'd be here by now~wish i had concentrated
they said love was complicated
but it's something i just fell into
and it was overrated
but just look what i've created
i came out alive but i'm black and blue


before you ask me if i'm alright
think about what i had to do, yeah


wake up and smell the breakup
fix my heart, put on my makeup
another mess i didn't plan
and i'll bet you thought you'd beat me
wish you could only see
i got an $i heart question mark$
written on the back of my hand


i'd be fine if you just walked by
but you had to talk about why
you were wrong and i was right
but i can't believe you made me
sit at home, cry like a baby
wait right by the phone every night


and now you ask about you and i
there's no you and i
remember what you put me through, i had to


wake up and smell the breakup
fix my heart, put on my makeup
another mess i didn't plan
and i'll bet you thought you'd beat me
wish you could only see
i got an $i heart question mark$
written on the back of my hand


and when you're home all alone at night
you'll still wonder why
you took everything i had, oh, baby
i haven't thought about you and i
there's no you and i
and i know someday you will


wake up and smell the breakup
realize that we won't make up
it didn't go the way you planned
and you'll know you didn't beat me
when you look down and see
i got an $i heart question mark$
written on the back of my hand

written on the back of my hand
an $i heart question mark,$ yeah
written on the back of my hand~i remember what you wore on the first day
you came into my life and i thought
$hey, you know, this could be something$
'cause everything you do and words you say
you know that it all takes my breath away
and now i'm left with nothing


so maybe it's true that i can't live without you
and maybe two is better than one
but there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
and you've already got me coming undone
and i'm thinking two is better than one


i remember every look upon your face
the way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
you make it hard for breathing
'cause when i close my eyes and drift away
i think of you and everything's okay
i'm finally now believing


then maybe it's true that i can't live without you
and maybe two is better than one
but there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
and you've already got me coming undone
and i'm thinking two is better than one
you might also like
i remember what you wore on the first day
you came into my life and i thought, hey $hey, hey$


maybe it's true that i can't live without you
and maybe two is better than one
but there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
and you've already got me coming undone


and i'm thinking, ooh, i can't live without you
'cause, baby, two is better than one
there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
but i'll figure out with all that's said and done
two is better than one
two is better than one~you say, $i don't understand,$ and i say, $i know you don't$
we thought a cure would come through in time, now, i fear it won't
remember lookin' at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
now, i just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time


do i throw out everything we built or keep it$
i'm getting tired even for a phoenix
always risin' from the ashes
mendin' all her gashes
you might just have dealt the final blow


stop, you're losin' me
stop, you're losin' me
stop, you're losin' me
i can't find a pulse
my heart won't start anymore for you
'cause you're losin' me


every mornin', i glared at you with storms in my eyes
how can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'$
i sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
my face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick


and the air is thick with loss and indecision
i know my pain is such an imposition
now, you're runnin' down the hallway
and you know what they all say
$you don't know what you got until it's gone$


stop, you're losin' me
stop, you're losin' me
stop, you're losin' me
i can't find a pulse
my heart won't start anymore for you
'cause you're losin' me
'cause you're losin' me
stop $stop$ 'cause you're losin' me


my heart won't start anymore
$stop 'cause you're losin' me$
my heart won't start anymore
$stop 'cause you're losin' me$


how long could we be a sad song
'til we were too far gone to bring back to life$
i gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
and all i did was bleed as i tried to be the bravest soldier
fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
i'm the best thing at this party $you're losin' me$
and i wouldn't marry me either
a pathological people pleaser
who only wanted you to see her
and i'm fadin', thinkin'
$do something, babe, say something$ $say something$
$lose something, babe, risk something$ $you're losin' me$
$choose something, babe, i got nothing$ $i got nothing$
$to believe, unless you're choosin' me$

you're losin' me
stop $stop, stop$, you're losin' me
stop $stop, stop$, you're losin' me
i can't find a pulse
my heart won't start anymore~salt air, and the rust on your door
i never needed anything more
whispers of $are you sure$$
$never have i ever before$


but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine


your back beneath the sun
wishin' i could write my name on it
will you call when you're back at school$
i remember thinkin' i had you


but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine


back when we were still changin' for the better
wanting was enough
for me, it was enough
to live for the hope of it all
cancel plans just in case you'd call
and say, $meet me behind the mall$
so much for summer love and saying $us$
'cause you weren't mine to lose
you weren't mine to lose, no


but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine


'cause you were never mine
never mine
but do you remember$
remember when i pulled up and said $get in the car$
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call$
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
$meet me behind the mall$
$remember when i pulled up and said $get in the car$$
$and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call$$
$back when i was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all$
$$meet me behind the mall$$
remember when i pulled up and said $get in the car$
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call$
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all $for the hope of it all$
for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
$for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all$~betty, i won't make assumptions
about why you switched your homeroom, but
i think it's 'cause of me
betty, one time, i was riding on my skateboard
when i passed your house
it's like i couldn't breathe


you heard the rumors from inez
you can't believe a word she says
most times, but this time, it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you


but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me$ would you want me$
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden$
in the garden, would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing$
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you


betty, i know where it all went wrong
your favorite song was playing
from the far side of the gym
i was nowhere to be found
i hate the crowds, you know that
plus, i saw you dance with him


you heard the rumors from inez
you can't believe a word she says
most times, but this time, it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you


but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me$ would you want me$
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden$
in the garden, would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing$
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you


i was walking home on broken cobblestones
just thinking of you when she pulled up like
a figment of my worst intentions
she said, $james, get in, let's drive$
those days turned into nights
slept next to her, but
i dreamt of you all summer long

betty, i'm here on your doorstep
and i planned it out for weeks now
but it's finally sinkin' in
betty, right now is the last time
i can dream about what happens when
you see my face again


the only thing i wanna do
is make it up to you
so i showed up at your party
yeah, i showed up at your party


yeah, i showed up at your party
will you have me$ will you love me$
will you kiss me on the porch
in front of all your stupid friends$
if you kiss me, will it be just like i dreamed it$
will it patch your broken wings$
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you


standing in your cardigan
kissin' in my car again
stopped at a streetlight
you know i miss you~vintage tee, brand new phone
high heels on cobblestones
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
sequin smile, black lipstick
sensual politics
when you are young, they assume you know nothing


but i knew you
dancin' in your levi's
drunk under a streetlight, i
i knew you
hand under my sweatshirt
baby, kiss it better, i


and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite


a friend to all is a friend to none
chase two girls, lose the one
when you are young, they assume you know nothing


but i knew you
playing hide$and$seek and
giving me your weekends, i
i knew you
your heartbeat on the high line
once in twenty lifetimes, i


and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite


to kiss in cars and downtown bars
was all we needed
you drew stars around my scars
but now i'm bleedin'


'cause i knew you
steppin' on the last train
marked me like a bloodstain, i
i knew you
tried to change the ending
peter losing wendy, i
i knew you
leavin' like a father
running like water, i
and when you are young, they assume you know nothing

but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
i knew you'd haunt all of my what$ifs
the smell of smoke would hang around this long
'cause i knew everything when i was young
i knew i'd curse you for the longest time
chasin' shadows in the grocery line
i knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
and you'd be standin' in my front porch light
and i knew you'd come back to me
you'd come back to me
and you'd come back to me
and you'd come back


and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite~keep your helmet, keep your life, son
just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
crawling up the beaches now
$sir, i think he's bleeding out$
and some things you just can't speak about


with you i serve, with you i fall down, down
watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out


something med school did not cover
someone's daughter, someone's mother
holds your hand through plastic now
$doc, i think she's crashing out$
and some things you just can't speak about


only twenty minutes to sleep
but you dream of some epiphany
just one single glimpse of relief
to make some sense of what you've seen


with you i serve, with you i fall down, down $down$
watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
with you i serve $with you i serve$, with you i fall down $down$, down $down$
watch you breathe in $watch you breathe in$, watch you breathing out $out$, out $out$


only twenty minutes to sleep
but you dream of some epiphany
just one single glimpse of relief
to make some sense of what you've seen~i can see you standing, honey
with his arms around your body
laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
and it took you five whole minutes
to pack us up and leave me with it
holdin' all this love out here in the hall


i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
you're not my homeland anymore
so what am i defending now$
you were my town, now i'm in exile, seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before


ooh, ooh, ooh


i can see you starin', honey
like he's just your understudy
like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
second, third, and hundredth chances
balancin' on breaking branches
those eyes add insult to injury


i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
i'm not your problem anymore
so who am i offending now$
you were my crown, now i'm in exile, seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before
so i'm leaving out the side door

so step right out, there is no amount
of crying i can do for you
all this time
we always walked a very thin line
you didn't even hear me out $you didn't even hear me out$
you never gave a warning sign $i gave so many signs$
all this time
i never learned to read your mind $never learned to read my mind$
i couldn't turn things around $you never turned things around$
'cause you never gave a warning sign $i gave so many signs$
so many signs, so many signs
you didn't even see the signs


i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
you're not my homeland anymore
so what am i defending now$
you were my town, now i'm in exile, seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before
so i'm leavin' out the side door

so step right out, there is no amount
of crying i can do for you
all this time
we always walked a very thin line
you didn't even hear me out $didn't even hear me out$
you never gave a warning sign $i gave so many signs$
all this time
i never learned to read your mind $never learned to read my mind$
i couldn't turn things around $you never turned things around$
'cause you never gave a warning sign $i gave so many signs$
you never gave a warning sign $all this time$
$so many times$ i never learned to read your mind
$so many signs$ i couldn't turn things around $i couldn't turn things around$
'cause you never gave a warning sign $you never gave a warning sign$
you never gave a warning sign
ah, ah~my only one
my smoking gun
my eclipsed sun
this has broken me down
my twisted knife
my sleepless night
my winless fight
this has frozen my ground


stood on the cliffside screaming, $give me a reason$
your faithless love's the only hoax i believe in
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do


my best laid plan
your sleight of hand
my barren land
i am ash from your fire


stood on the cliffside screaming, $give me a reason$
your faithless love's the only hoax i believe in
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do


you know i left a part of me back in new york
you knew the hero died so what's the movie for$
you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart
you knew the password so i let you in the door
you knew you won so what's the point of keeping score$
you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart
but what you did was just as dark
$ah, ah, ah$
darling, this was just as hard
as when they pulled me apart


my only one
my kingdom come undone
my broken drum
you have beaten my heart
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do~make sure nobody sees you leave
hood over your head, keep your eyes down
tell your friends you're out for a run
you'll be flushed when you return
take the road less traveled by
tell yourself you can always stop
what started in beautiful rooms
ends with meetings in parking lots


and that's the thing about illicit affairs
and clandestine meetings and longing stares
it's born from just one single glance
but it dies and it dies and it dies
a million little times


leave the perfume on the shelf
that you picked out just for him
so you leave no trace behind
like you don't even exist
take the words for what they are
a dwindling, mercurial high
a drug that only worked
the first few hundred times


and that's the thing about illicit affairs
and clandestine meetings and stolen stares
they show their truth one single time
but they lie and they lie and they lie
a million little times


and you wanna scream
don't call me $kid,$ don't call me $baby$
look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
you showed me colors you know i can't see with anyone else
don't call me $kid,$ don't call me $baby$
look at this idiotic fool that you made me
you taught me a secret language i can't speak with anyone else


and you know damn well
for you, i would ruin myself
a million little times~green was the color of the grass
where i used to read at centennial park
i used to think i would meet somebody there
teal was the color of your shirt
when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
you used to work at to make a little money


time, curious time
gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
were there clues i didn't see$
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me$
ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh


bad was the blood of the song in the cab
on your first trip to la
you ate at my favorite spot for dinner
bold was the waitress on our three$year trip
getting lunch down by the lakes
she said i looked like an american singer


time, mystical time
cutting me open, then healing me fine
were there clues i didn't see$
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me$
ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh


a string that pulled me
out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
chains around my demons
wool to brave the seasons
one single thread of gold
tied me to you


cold was the steel of my axe to grind
for the boys who broke my heart
now i send their babies presents
gold was the color of the leaves
when i showed you around centennial park
hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven

time, wondrous time
gave me the blues and then purple$pink skies
and it's cool, baby, with me
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me$
ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh
me
ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh


$ah$ah$ah$
$ah$ah$ah$~what did you think i'd say to that$
does a scorpion sting when fighting back$
they strike to kill, and you know i will
you know i will
what do you sing on your drive home$
do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn$
does she smile$
or does she mouth, $fuck you forever$$


every time you call me crazy, i get more crazy
what about that$
and when you say i seem angry, i get more angry


and there's nothing like a mad woman
what a shame she went mad
no one likes a mad woman
you made her like that
and you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
and you find something to wrap your noose around
and there's nothing like a mad woman


now i breathe flames each time i talk
my cannons all firin' at your yacht
they say, $move on,$ but you know i won't
and women like hunting witches too
doing your dirtiest work for you
it's obvious that wanting me dead
has really brought you two together


every time you call me crazy, i get more crazy
what about that$
and when you say i seem angry, i get more angry


and there's nothing like a mad woman
what a shame she went mad
no one likes a mad woman
you made her like that
and you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
and you find something to wrap your noose around
and there's nothing like a mad woman


i'm taking my time, taking my time
'cause you took everything from me
watching you climb, watching you climb
over people like me
the master of spin has a couple side flings
good wives always know
she should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
no one likes a mad woman


what a shame she went mad
you made her like that~i want you to know
i'm a mirrorball
i'll show you every version of yourself tonight
i'll get you out on the floor
shimmering beautiful
and when i break, it's in a million pieces


hush, when no one is around, my dear
you'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
spinning in my highest heels, love
shining just for you
hush, i know they said the end is near
but i'm still on my tallest tiptoes
spinning in my highest heels, love
shining just for you


i want you to know
i'm a mirrorball
i can change everything about me to fit in
you are not like the regulars
the masquerade revelers
drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten


hush, when no one is around, my dear
you'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
spinning in my highest heels, love
shining just for you
hush, i know they said the end is near
but i'm still on my tallest tiptoes
spinning in my highest heels, love
shining just for you


and they called off the circus, burned the disco down
when they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
i'm still on that tightrope
i'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
and i'm still a believer, but i don't know why
i've never been a natural, all i do is try, try, try
i'm still on that trapeze
i'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me


because i'm a mirrorball
i'm a mirrorball
and i'll show you every version of yourself tonight~we gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
and if i'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
even on my worst day, did i deserve, babe
all the hell you gave me$
'cause i loved you, i swear i loved you
'til my dying day


i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and you're the hero flying around, saving face
and if i'm dead to you, why are you at the wake$
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet


we gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
you know i didn't want to have to haunt you
but what a ghostly scene
you wear the same jewels that i gave you
as you bury me


i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'cause when i'd fight, you used to tell me i was brave
and if i'm dead to you, why are you at the wake$
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet


and i can go anywhere i want
anywhere i want, just not home
and you can aim for my heart, go for blood
but you would still miss me in your bones
and i still talk to you $when i'm screaming at the sky$
and when you can't sleep at night $you hear my stolen lullabies$


i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
you had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
you turned into your worst fears
and you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
crossing out the good years
and you're cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet~our coming$of$age has come and gone
suddenly, this summer, it's clear
i never had the courage of my convictions
as long as danger is near
and it's just around the corner, darlin'
'cause it lives in me
no, i could never give you peace


but i'm a fire and i'll keep your brittle heart warm
if your cascade, ocean wave blues come
all these people think love's for show
but i would die for you in secret
the devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
would it be enough if i could never give you peace$


your integrity makes me seem small
you paint dreamscapes on the wall
i talk shit with my friends, it's like i'm wasting your honor
and you know that i'd swing with you for the fences
sit with you in the trenches
give you my wild, give you a child
give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
family that i chose, now that i see your brother as my brother
is it enough$
but there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
i'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
but the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me


but i'm a fire and i'll keep your brittle heart warm
if your cascade, ocean wave blues come
all these people think love's for show
but i would die for you in secret
the devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
would it be enough if i could never give you peace$
would it be enough if i could never give you peace$
would it be enough if i could never give you peace$~please picture me in the trees
i hit my peak at seven
feet in the swing over the creek
i was too scared to jump in
but i, i was high in the sky
with pennsylvania under me
are there still beautiful things$


sweet tea in the summer
cross your heart, won't tell no other
and though i can't recall your face
i still got love for you
your braids like a pattern
love you to the moon and to saturn
passed down like folk songs
the love lasts so long


and i've been meaning to tell you
i think your house is haunted
your dad is always mad and that must be why
and i think you should come live with me
and we can be pirates
then you won't have to cry
or hide in the closet
and just like a folk song
our love will be passed on


please picture me in the weeds
before i learned civility
i used to scream ferociously
any time i wanted
i, i


sweet tea in the summer
cross my heart, won't tell no other
and though i can't recall your face
i still got love for you
pack your dolls and a sweater
we'll move to india forever
passed down like folk songs
our love lasts so long~i'm doing good, i'm on some new shit
been saying $yes$ instead of $no$
i thought i saw you at the bus stop, i didn't though
i hit the ground running each night
i hit the sunday matin$e
you know the greatest films of all time were never made


i guess you never know, never know
and if you wanted me, you really should've showed
and if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
and it's alright now


but we were something, don't you think so$
roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
and if my wishes came true
it would've been you
in my defense, i have none
for never leaving well enough alone
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
$ooh$


i have this dream you're doing cool shit
having adventures on your own
you meet some woman on the internet and take her home
we never painted by the numbers, baby
but we were making it count
you know the greatest loves of all time are over now


i guess you never know, never know
and it's another day waking up alone


but we were something, don't you think so$
roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
and if my wishes came true
it would've been you
in my defense, i have none
for never leaving well enough alone
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one


i, i, i persist and resist the temptation to ask you
if one thing had been different
would everything be different today$


we were something, don't you think so$
ros$ flowing with your chosen family
and it would've been sweet
if it could've been me
in my defense, i have none
for digging up the grave another time
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
$ooh$~rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off st$ louis
bill was the heir to the standard oil name and money
and the town said, $how did a middle$class divorc$e do it$$
the wedding was charming, if a little gauche
there's only so far new money goes
they picked out a home and called it $holiday house$
their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
the doctor had told him to settle down
it must have been her fault his heart gave out


and they said
$there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
there goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything$


rebekah gave up on the rhode island set forever
flew in all her bitch pack friends from the city
filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
and blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
and losing on card game bets with dal$


and they said
$there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
there goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything$


they say she was seen on occasion
pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
and in a feud with her neighbor
she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
fifty years is a long time
holiday house sat quietly on that beach
free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
and then it was bought by me


who knows, if i never showed up, what could've been
there goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
i had a marvelous time ruining everything


i had a marvelous time ruining everything
a marvelous time ruining everything
a marvelous time
i had a marvelous time~i've been having a hard time adjusting
i had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
i didn't know if you'd care if i came back
i have a lot of regrets about that
pulled the car off the road to the lookout
could've followed my fears all the way down
and maybe i don't quite know what to say
but i'm here in your doorway


i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying

they told me all of my cages were mental
so i got wasted like all my potential
and my words shoot to kill when i'm mad
i have a lot of regrets about that
i was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
fell behind all my classmates and i ended up here
pouring out my heart to a stranger
but i didn't pour the whiskey


i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying


at least i'm trying


and it's hard to be at a party when i feel like an open wound
it's hard to be anywhere these days when all i want is you
you're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town


and i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
$and maybe i don't quite know what to say$
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying


at least i'm trying~you booked the night train for a reason
so you could sit there in this hurt
bustling crowds or silent sleepers
you're not sure which is worse


because i dropped your hand while dancing
left you out there standing
crestfallen on the landing
champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
my picture in your wallet
your heart was glass, i dropped it
champagne problems


you told your family for a reason
you couldn't keep it in
your sister splashed out on the bottle
now no one's celebrating


dom p$rignon, you brought it
no crowd of friends applauded
your hometown skeptics called it
champagne problems
you had a speech, you're speechless
love slipped beyond your reaches
and i couldn't give a reason
champagne problems


your midas touch on the chevy door
november flush and your flannel cure
$this dorm was once a madhouse$
i made a joke, $well, it's made for me$
how evergreen, our group of friends
don't think we'll say that word again
and soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
that we once walked through
one for the money, two for the show
i never was ready so i watch you go
sometimes you just don't know the answer
'til someone's on their knees and asks you
$she would've made such a lovely bride
what a shame she's fucked in the head,$ they said
but you'll find the real thing instead
she'll patch up your tapestry that i shred


and hold your hand while dancing
never leave you standing
crestfallen on the landing
with champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
her picture in your wallet
you won't remember all my
champagne problems

you won't remember all my
champagne problems~it's been a long time
and seeing the shape of your name
still spells out pain
it wasn't right
the way it all went down
looks like you know that now


yes, i got your letter
yes, i'm doing better
it cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
yes, i got your letter
yes, i'm doing better
i know that it's over, i don't need your
closure, your closure


don't treat me like
some situation that needs to be handled
i'm fine with my spite
and my tears, and my beers and my candles
i can feel you smoothing me over


yes, i got your letter
yes, i'm doing bett$r
it cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
yes, i got your l$tter
yes, i'm doing better
i know that it's over, i don't need your
closure, your closure
your closure, your closure


i know i'm just a wrinkle in your new life
staying friends would iron it out so nice
guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
that you put between you and me
but it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary


yes, i got your letter
yes, i'm doing better
it cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
yes, i got your letter
yes, i'm doing better
i know that it's over, i don't need your
closure, closure, your closure
your closure~break my soul in two looking for you
but you're right here
if i can't relate to you anymore
then who am i related to$
and if this is the long haul
how'd we get here so soon$
did i close my fist around something delicate$
did i shatter you$


and i'm sitting on a bench in coney island
wondering where did my baby go$
the fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
sorry for not making you my centerfold


over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments, close your eyes
and it gets colder and colder
when the sun goes down


the question pounds my head
what's a lifetime of achievement
if i pushed you to the edge$
but you were too polite to leave me
and do you miss the rogue
who coaxed you into paradise and left you there$
will you forgive my soul
when you're too wise to trust me and too old to care$


'cause we were like the mall before the internet
it was the one place to be
the mischief, the gift$wrapped suburban dreams
sorry for not winning you an arcade ring


over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments, close your eyes
and it gets colder and colder
when the sun goes down


were you waiting at our old spot
in the tree line
by the gold clock
did i leave you hanging every single day$
were you standing in the hallway
with a big cake, happy birthday
did i paint your bluest skies the darkest grey$
a universe away
and when i got into the accident
the sight that flashed before me was your face
but when i walked up to the podium, i think that i forgot to say your name

i'm on a bench in coney island
wondering where did my baby go$
the fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
sorry for not making you my centerfold


over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments, close your eyes
and it gets colder and colder
when the sun goes down


when the sun goes down
the sight that flashed before me was your face
when the sun goes down
but i think that i forgot to say your name
over and over
sorry for not making you my, making you my
making you my centerfold~and the tennis court was covered up
with some tent$like thing
and you asked me to dance
but i said, $dancin' is a dangerous game$
oh, i thought
this is gonna be one of those things
now i know
i'm never gonna love again


i've got some tricks up my sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me


never wanted love
just a fancy car
now i'm waiting by the phone
like i'm sitting in an airport bar

you had some tricks up your sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me


perched in the dark
tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
like it could be love
i could be the way forward
only if they pay for it
you're a bandit like me
eyes full of stars
hustling for the good life
never thought i'd meet you here
it could be love
we could be the way forward
and i know i'll pay for it


you're a cowboy like me
perched in the dark
tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
like it could be love
i could be the way forward
only if they pay for it
you're a bandit like me
eyes full of stars
hustlin' for the good life
never thought i'd meet you here
it could be love
we could be the way forward
and i know i'll pay for it

and the skeletons in both our closets
plotted hard to fuck this up
and the old men that i've swindled
really did believe i was the one
and the ladies lunchin' have their stories about
when you passed through town
oh, but that was all before i locked it down


now you hang from my lips
like the gardens of babylon
with your boots beneath my bed
forever is the sweetest con


i've had some tricks up my sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me


and i'm never gonna love again
i'm never gonna love again
i'm never gonna love again~hey, dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me$
when we were younger, down in the park
honey, makin' a lark of the misery
you got shiny friends since you left town
a tiny screen's the only place i see you now
and i got nothin' but well wishes for ya


ooh
this place is the same as it ever was
ooh
but you won't like it that way


it's never too late to come back to my side
the stars in your eyes shined brighter in tupelo
and if you're ever tired of b$in' known for who you know
you know that you'll always know me
dorothea, uh$uh
dorothea, ah$ah


ooh
you'r$ a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
ooh
from you, i'd buy anything


hey, dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me$
when it was calmer, skippin' the prom
just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
and damn, dorothea, they all wanna be ya
but are you still the same soul i met under the bleachers$ well


ooh
i guess i'll never know
ooh
and you'll go on with the show


but it's never too late to come back to my side
the stars in your eyes shined brighter in tupelo
and if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know
you know, you'll always know me
dorothea, uh$uh
dorothea, ah$ah


ooh, ooh
ooh$woo$ooh$ooh$ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh$ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh$woo$ooh$ooh$ooh, ooh$ooh$ooh
dorothea $ah$ah$ah$
ah$ah
ooh~gray november
i've been down since july
motion capture
put me in a bad light
i replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
trying to find the one where i went wrong
writing letters
addressed to the fire


and i was catchin' my breath
starin' out an open window, catchin' my death
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
that this pain would be for
evermore


hey, december
guess i'm feeling unmoored
can't remember
what i used to fight for
i rewind th$ tape, but all it does is pause
on th$ very moment all was lost
sending signals
to be double$crossed


and i was catchin' my breath
barefoot in the wildest winter, catchin' my death
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
that this pain would be for
evermore


$evermore$

can't not think of all the cost
and the things that will be lost
oh, can we just get a pause$
to be certain we'll be tall again
whether weather be the frost
or the violence of the dog days
i'm on waves, out being tossed
is there a line that i could just go cross$
and when i was shipwrecked $can't think of all the cost now$
i thought of you $all the things that will be lost now$
in the cracks of light $can we just get a pause$$
i dreamed of you $to be certain we'll be tall again$
$if you think of all the cost$
it was real enough $whether weather be the frost$
to get me through $or the violence of the dog days$
$or the violence of the dog days$
$out on waves, being tossed$
$i'm on waves, out being tossed$
but i swear $is there a line that we can just go cross$$
you were there

and i was catchin' my breath
floors of a cabin creakin' under my step
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
this pain wouldn't be for
evermore


evermore $evermore$
evermore $evermore$
this pain wouldn't be for evermore
evermore~gleaming, twinkling
eyes like sinking
ships on waters
so inviting, i almost jump in


but i don't like a gold rush, gold rush
i don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
i don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
everybody wants you
everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
walk past, quick brush
i don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
i don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
everybody wants you
but i don't like a gold rush


what must it be like to grow up that beautiful$
with your hair falling into place like dominoes
i see me padding across your wooden floors
with my eagles t$shirt hanging from the door


at dinner parties, i call you out on your contrarian shit
and the coastal town we wandered 'round had n$ver seen a love as pure as it
and th$n it fades into the gray of my day$old tea
'cause it could never be


'cause i don't like a gold rush, gold rush
i don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
i don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
everybody wants you
everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
walk past, quick brush
i don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
i don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
everybody wants you
but i don't like a gold rush


what must it be like to grow up that beautiful$
with your hair falling into place like dominoes
my mind turns your life into folklore
i can't dare to dream about you anymore


at dinner parties, i won't call you out on your contrarian shit
and the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'cause it fades into the gray of my day$old tea
'cause it will never be


gleaming, twinkling
eyes like sinking
ships on waters
so inviting, i almost jump in~honey, when i'm above the trees
i see this for what it is
but now i'm right down in it, all the years i've given
is just shit we're dividin' up
showed you all of my hiding spots
i was dancing when the music stopped
and in the disbelief, i can't face reinvention
i haven't met the new me yet


there'll be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you
both of these things can be true
there is happiness


past the blood and bruise
past the curses and cries
beyond the terror in the nightfall
haunted by the look in my eyes
that would've loved you for a lifetime
leave it all behind
and there is happiness


tell me, when did your winning smile
begin to look like a smirk$
when did all our lessons start to look like weapons
pointed at my deepest hurt$
i hope she'll be a beautiful fool
who takes my spot next to you
no, i didn't mean that
sorry, i can't see facts through all of my fury
you haven't met the new me yet


there'll be happiness after me
but there was happiness because of me
both of these things, i believe
there is happiness


in our history, across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight, leave it all behind
and there is happiness


i can't make it go away by making you a villain
i guess it's the price i paid for seven years in heaven
and i pulled your body into mine
every goddamn night, now i get fake niceties
no one teaches you what to do
when a good man hurts you
and you know you hurt him too


honey, when i'm above the trees
i see it for what it is
but now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
after giving you the best i had
tell me what to give after that
all you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
you haven't met the new me yet
and i think she'll give you that

there'll be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you too
both of these things can be true
there is happiness


in our history, across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight, leave it all behind
oh, leave it all behind
leave it all behind
and there is happiness~how's one to know$
i'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
in a faith$forgotten land
in from the snow
your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
tarnished but so grand


and the old widow goes to the stone every day
but i don't, i just sit here and wait
grieving for the living


oh, goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking mine, but it's been promised to another
oh, i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone, your ivy grows
and now i'm covered in you


i wish to know
the fatal flaw that makes you long to be
magnificently cursed
he's in the room
your opal eyes are all i wish to see
he wants what's only yours


oh, goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking mine, but it's been promised to another
oh, i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone, your ivy grows
and now i'm covered


clover blooms in the fields
spring breaks loose, the time is near
what would he do if he found us out$
crescent moon, coast is clear
spring breaks loose, but so does fear
he's gonna burn this house to the ground
how's one to know$
i'd live and die for moments that we stole
on begged and borrowed time
so tell me to run
or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
and drink my husband's wine


oh, goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking mine, but it's been promised to another
oh, i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone, your ivy grows
and now i'm covered in you
and i'm covered in you

so yeah, it's a fire
it's a goddamn blaze in the dark
and you started it
you started it
so yeah, it's a war
it's the goddamn fight of my life
and you started it
you started it


oh, i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone, your ivy grows
and now i'm covered
in you, in you
now i'm covered in you
in you~fatefully
i tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
misery
like the war of words i shouted in my sleep
and you passed right by
i was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
the knife cuts both ways
if the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break


and i fell from the pedestal
right down the rabbit hole
long story short, it was a bad time
pushed from the precipice
clung to the nearest lips
long story short, it was the wrong guy


now i'm all about you
i'm all about you, ah
yeah, yeah
i'm all about you, ah
yeah, yeah


actually
i always felt i must look better in the rear view
missing me
at the golden gates they once held the keys to
when i dropped my sword
i threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
and we live in peace
but if someone comes at us, this time, i'm ready


'cause i fell from the pedestal
right down the rabbit hole
long story short, it was a bad time
pushed from the precipice
clung to the nearest lips
long story short, it was the wrong guy


now i'm all about you
i'm all about you, ah
yeah, yeah
i'm all about you


no more keepin' score
now i just keep you warm $keep you warm$
no more tug of war
now i just know there's more $know there's more$
no more keepin' score
now i just keep you warm $keep you warm$
and my waves meet your shore
ever and evermore


past me
i wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
your nemeses
will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
and he's passing by
rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
and he feels like home
if the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

and i fell from the pedestal
right down the rabbit hole
long story short, it was a bad time
pushed from the precipice
climbed right back up the cliff
long story short, i survived


now i'm all about you
$and now$ i'm all about you, ah
$and now$ i'm all about you
$and now$ i'm all about you, ah
yeah, yeah
i'm all about you
$and now$ yeah, yeah
i'm all about you


long story short, it was a bad time
long story short, i survived~never be so kind
you forget to be clever
never be so clever
you forget to be kind


and if i didn't know better
i'd think you were talking to me now
if i didn't know better
i'd think you were still around


what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive, you're alive in my head
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive, so alive


never be so polit$
you forget your power
nev$r wield such power
you forget to be polite


and if i didn't know better
i'd think you were listening to me now
if i didn't know better
i'd think you were still around


what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive, you're alive in my head
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive, so alive


the autumn chill that wakes me up
you loved the amber skies so much
long limbs and frozen swims
you'd always go past where our feet could touch
and i complained the whole way there
the car ride back and up the stairs
i should've asked you questions
i should've asked you how to be
asked you to write it down for me
should've kept every grocery store receipt
'cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
watched as you signed your name marjorie
all your closets of backlogged dreams
and how you left them all to me

what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive, you're alive in my head
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive, so alive


and if i didn't know better
i'd think you were singing to me now
if i didn't know better
i'd think you were still around
i know better
but i still feel you all around
i know better
but you're still around~he did it
he did it


este's a friend of mine
we meet up every tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
este's been losin' sleep
her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
she says, $that ain't my merlot on his mouth
that ain't my jewelry on our joint account$
no, there ain't no doubt
i think i'm gonna call him out


she says, $i think he did it, but i just can't prove it$
i think he did it, but i just can't prove it
i think he did it, but i just can't prove it
no, no body, no crime
but i ain't lettin' up until the day i die


no, no
i think he did it
no, no
he did it


este wasn't there tuesday night at olive gard$n
at her job or anywhere
h$ reports his missing wife
and i noticed when i passed his house
his truck has got some brand new tires
and his mistress moved in
sleeps in este's bed and everything
no, there ain't no doubt
somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause


i think he did it, but i just can't prove it $he did it$
i think he did it, but i just can't prove it $he did it$
i think he did it, but i just can't prove it
no, no body, no crime
but i ain't lettin' up until the day i die


no, no
i think he did it
no, no
he did it


good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when i was fifteen
and i've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
good thing este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
$she was with me, dude$
good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

they think she did it, but they just can't prove it
they think she did it, but they just can't prove it
she thinks i did it, but she just can't prove it


no, no body, no crime
i wasn't lettin' up until the day he
no, no body, no crime
i wasn't lettin' up until the day he
no, no body, no crime
i wasn't lettin' up until the day he died~if i wanted to know who you were hanging with
while i was gone, i would've asked you
it's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
but i felt it when i passed you
there's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
but if it's all the same to you
it's the same to me


so we could call it even
you could call me $babe$ for the weekend
 'tis the damn season, write this down
i'm stayin' at my parents' house
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown


i park$d my car right between the methodist
and th$ school that used to be ours
the holidays linger like bad perfume
you can run, but only so far
i escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
but if it's okay with you, it's okay with me


we could call it even
you could call me $babe$ for the weekend
 'tis the damn season, write this down
i'm stayin' at my parents' house
and the road not taken looks real good now
time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
now i'm missing your smile, hear me out
we could just ride around
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown


sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
i won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
so i'll go back to l$a$ and the so$called friends
who'll write books about me if i ever make it
and wonder about the only soul
who can tell which smiles i'm fakin'
and the heart i know i'm breakin' is my own
to leave the warmest bed i've ever known
we could call it even
even though i'm leaving
and i'll be yours for the weekend
 'tis the damn season


we could call it even
you could call me $babe$ for the weekend
 'tis the damn season, write this down
i'm stayin' at my parents' house
and the road not taken looks real good now
time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
now i'm missing your smile, hear me out
we could just ride around
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown

it always leads to you and my hometown~i sit and watch you reading with your head low
i wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
i sit and watch you
i notice everything you do or don't do
you're so much older and wiser, and i


i wait by the door like i'm just a kid
use my best colors for your portrait
lay the table with the fancy shit
and watch you tolerate it
if it's all in my head, tell me now
tell me i've got it wrong somehow
i know my love should be celebrated
but you tolerate it


i greet you with a battle hero's welcome
i take your indiscretions all in good fun
i sit and list$n, i polish plates until they gleam and glist$n
you're so much older and wiser and i


i wait by the door like i'm just a kid
use my best colors for your portrait
lay the table with the fancy shit
and watch you tolerate it
if it's all in my head, tell me now
tell me i've got it wrong somehow
i know my love should be celebrated
but you tolerate it


while you were out building other worlds, where was i$
where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire$
i made you my temple, my mural, my sky
now i'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
drawing hearts in the byline
always taking up too much space or time
you assume i'm fine, but what would you do if i


break free and leave us in ruins
took this dagger in me and removed it
gain the weight of you, then lose it
believe me, i could do it
if it's all in my head, tell me now
tell me i've got it wrong somehow
i know my love should be celebrated
but you tolerate it


i sit and watch you~i'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
and if it was an open$shut case
i never would've known from that look on your face
lost in your current like a priceless wine


the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man


life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
head on the pillow, i could feel you sneakin' in
as if you were a mythical thing
like you were a trophy or a champion ring
and there was one prize i'd cheat to win


the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man


life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
they count me out time and time again
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
but i come back stronger than a '$$s trend


wait for the signal, and i'll meet you after dark
show me the places where the others gave you scars
now this is an open$shut case
i guess i should've known from the look on your face
every bait$and$switch was a work of art


the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man

hey, that's my man
that's my man
yeah, that's my man
every bait$and$switch was a work of art
that's my man
hey, that's my man
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man~i'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
let it take me where it wants to go
'til you open the door, there's so much more
i'd never seen it before
i was tryin' to fly but i couldn't find wings
but you came along and you changed everything


you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm fallin' and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier


i've watched from a distance as you made life your own
every sky was your own kind of blue
and i wanted to know how that would feel
and you made it so real
you showed me somethin' that i couldn't see
you opened my eyes
and you made me believe


you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm fallin' and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh


baby, you showed me what livin' is for
i don't wanna hide anymore
oh$oh


you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm fallin' and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier
crazier, crazier~when the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
you ask for the tab
or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
look at each other like that
when the words of a sister come back in whispers
that prove she was not
in fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
she's a crook who was caught


that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
you know when it's time to go


twenty years at your job, then the son of the boss
gets the spot that was yours
or trying to stay for the kids, when keeping it how it is
will only break their hearts worse


that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
you know when it's time to go


sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
sometimes, to run is the brave thing
sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
sometimes, to run is the brave thing
sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing


fifteen years, fifteen million tears
begging 'til my knees bled
i gave it my all, he gave me nothin' at all
then wondered why i left
now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
praying to his greed
he's got my past frozen behind glass
but i've got me


that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
i know when it's time to go


sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
sometimes, to run is the brave thing
sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
sometimes, to run is the brave thing
sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing

that will find you the right thing
and you know in your soul
and you know in your soul
when it's time to go
and, well, you know, you know, you know, you know
when it's time to go
so then you go and then you go
you just go~friends break up, friends get married
strangers get born, strangers get buried
trends change, rumors fly through new skies
but i'm right where you left me
matches burn after the other
pages turn and stick to each other
wages earned and lessons learned
but i, i'm right where you left me


help, i'm still at the restaurant
still sitting in a corner i haunt
cross$legged in the dim light
they say, $what a sad sight,$ i
i swear you could hear a hair pin drop
right when i felt the moment stop
glass shattered on the white cloth
everybody moved on, i, i stayed there
dust collected on my pinned$up hair
they expected me to find somewhere
some perspective, but i sat and stared right where


you left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever
you left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever


did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen$
time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
she's still twenty$three inside her fantasy
how it was supposed to be
did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion$
breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
she's still twenty$three inside her fantasy
and you're sitting in front of me


at the restaurant
when i was still the one you want
cross$legged in the dim light
everything was just right, i
i could feel the mascara run
you told me that you met someone
glass shattered on the white cloth
everybody moved on
help, i'm still at the restaurant
still sitting in a corner i haunt
cross$legged in the dim light
they say, $what a sad sight,$ i, i stayed there
dust collected on my pinned$up hair
i'm sure that you got a wife out there
kids and christmas, but i'm unaware 'cause i'm right where
i cause no harm, mind my business
if our love died young, i can't bear witness, and it's been so long
if you ever think you got it wrong, i'm right where

you left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever
you left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever~knew he was a killer first time that i saw him
wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
but if he's a ghost, then i can be a phantom
holdin' him for ransom, some
some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
i see nothing better, i keep him forever
like a vendetta$ta


i, i, i see how this is gon' go
touch me and you'll never be alone
i$island breeze and lights down low
no one has to know


in the middle of the night, in my dreams
you should see the things we do, baby, mmm
in the middle of the night, in my dreams
i know i'm gonna be with you, so i take my time
are you ready for it$


knew i was a robber first time that he saw me
stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
but if i'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
we'll move to an island, and
and he can be my jailer, burton to this taylor
every love i've known in comparison is a failure
i forget their names now, i'm so very tame now
never be the same now, now


i, i, i see how this is gon' go
touch me and you'll never be alone
i$island breeze and lights down low

i'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
these hunters with cell phones


take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die
i don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
i'm setting off, but not without my muse


what should be over, burrowed under my skin
in heart$stopping waves of hurt
i've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
tell me what are my words worth


take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die
i don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
i'm setting off, but not without my muse


i want auroras and sad prose
i want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'cause i haven't moved in years
and i want you right here
a red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
with no one around to tweet it
while i bathe in cliffside pools
with my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die
i don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
i'm setting off, but not without my muse
no, not without you~what if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing$
would the song still survive without five golden rings$
would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe$
what would happen if god never let it snow$
what would happen if christmas carols told a lie$
tell me, what would you find$


you'd see that today holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more


what if angels did not pay attention to
all the things that we wished they would always do$
what if happiness came in a cardboard box$
then i think there is something we all forgot
what would happen if presents all went away$
tell me, what would you find$


you'd see that today holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more


we get so caught up in all of it
business and relationships
hundred$mile$an$hour lives
and it's this time of year
and everybody's here
it seems the last thing on your mind


is that the day holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
but here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something
christmas must be something
christmas must be something more


there's gotta be more
there's gotta be more~i tapped on your window on your darkest night
the shape of you was jagged and weak
there was nowhere for me to stay, but i stayed anyway
and if i would've known
how many pieces you had crumbled into
i might have let them lay


are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these$
and let all your damage damage me
and carry your baggage up my street
and make me your future history, it's time
you've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
you wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody


is it insensitive for me to say
$get your shit together so i can love you$$
is it really your anxiety that stops you
from giving me everything
or do you just not want to$


i tapped on your window on your darkest night
the shape of you was jagged and weak
there was nowhere for me to stay, but i stayed anyway
you fire off missiles 'cause you hate yourself
but do you know you're demolishing me$
and then you squeeze my hand as i'm about to leave

lost i was born, lonesome i came
lonesome i'll always stay
carolina knows why, for years, i roam
free as these birds, light as whispers
carolina knows


and you didn't see me here
no, they never did see me here
and she's in my dreams


into the mist, into the clouds
don't leave
i make a fist, i'll make it count
and there are places i will never, ever go
and things that only carolina will ever know


carolina stains on the dress she left
indelible scars, pivotal marks
blue as the life she fled
carolina pines, won't you cover me$
hide me like robes down the back road
muddy these webs we weave


and you didn't see me here
oh, they never did see me
and she's in my dreams


into the mist, into the clouds
don't leave
i make a fist, i'll make it count
and there are places i will never, ever go
and things that only carolina will ever know


and you didn't see me here
they never did see me here
no, you didn't see me here
they never saw me


oh, carolina knows why for years they've said
that i was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed
but the sleep comes fast and i'll meet no ghosts
it's between me, the sand, and the sea
carolina knows~i remember tears streaming down your face when i said, $i'll never let you go$
when all those shadows almost killed your light
i remember you said, $don't leave me here alone$
but all that's dead and gone and passed tonight


just close your eyes
the sun is going down
you'll be alright
no one can hurt you now
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound


don't you dare look out your window, darlin', everything's on fire
the war outside our door keeps ragin' on
hold on to this lullaby
even when th$ music's gone, gone


just close your $yes
the sun is going down
you'll be alright
no one can hurt you now
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound

just close your eyes
you'll be alright
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound


ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh~follow me home if you dare to
i wouldn't know where to lead you
should i take chances when no one took chances on me$
so i watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
with no beauty in my memory


all that i wanted was to be wanted
too young to wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
at least you have something, something to cling to
visions of dazzling rooms i'll never get let into
and the memories were lost long ago
but at least you have beautiful ghosts


perilous night, their voices calling
a flicker of light before the dawning
out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
scared to call them my friends and be broken again
is this hope just a mystical dream$


all that i wanted was to be wanted
too young to wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
at least you have something, something to cling to
visions of dazzling rooms i'll never get let into
and the memories were lost long ago
but at least you have beautiful ghosts


and so maybe my home isn't what i had known
what i thought it would be
but i feel so alive with these phantoms of night
and i know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free


all that i wanted was to be wanted
i'll never wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
with them, i have something, something to cling to
i never knew i'd love this world they've let me into
and the memories were lost long ago
so i'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
and the memories were lost long ago
so i'll dance with these beautiful ghosts~macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the hiddenpaw
for he's the master criminal who can defy the law
he's the bafflement of scotland yard, the flying squad's despair
for when they reach the scene of crime, macavity's not there


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
he's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
his powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
but when they reach the scene of crime, macavity's not there


macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
you would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
his brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
his coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
he sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
and when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
for he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
you may meet him in a by$street, you may see him in the square
but when a crime's discovered, then macavity's not there


he's outwardly respectable, i know, he cheats at cards
and his footprints are not found in any files of scotland yard's
and when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
there's the wonder of the thing, macavity's not there


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
he always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
what ever time the deed took place, macavity wasn't there
and they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
i might mention mungojerrie, rumpleteazer, griddlebone
are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
just controls the operations, the napoleon of crime
macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
you may meet him in a by$street, you may see him in the square
but when a crime's discovered, then macavity, macavity
macavity, macavity


when a crime's discovered, then
macavity's not there~my winter nights are taken up by static
stress and holiday shopping traffic
but i close my eyes and i'm somewhere else
just like magic


in my heart is a christmas tree farm
where the people would come
to dance under sparkling lights
bundled up in their mittens and coats
and the cider would flow
and i just wanna be there tonight


sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
mistakes are forgiven
and everythin' is icy and blue
and you would be there too


under the mistletoe
watchin' the fire glow
and tellin' me, $i love you$
just bein' in your arms
takes me back to that little farm
where every wish comes true


in my heart is a christmas tree farm
there's a light in the barn
we run inside out from the cold
in the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
and they're warm and they're safe
they wake to see a blanket of snow


sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
mistakes are forgiven
and everythin' is icy and blue
and you would be there too


under the mistletoe
watchin' the fire glow
and tellin' me, $i love you$
just bein' in your arms
takes me back to that little farm
where every wish comes true
baby, yeah


and when i'm feelin' alone
you remind me of home
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
and when the world isn't fair
i pretend that we're there
baby, baby, merry christmas $to you$

under the mistletoe $to you$
watching the fire glow
and tellin' me, $i love you$


oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas $darling$
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
i love you
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas $i just want you to know$
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
where every wish comes true
i love you~your beautiful eyes
stare right into mine
and sometimes, i think of you late at night
i don't know why


i wanna be somewhere where you are
i wanna be where


you're here, your eyes are lookin' into mine
so baby, make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
i'm looking through your $ 
i'm looking through your eyes


i wake up, i'm alive
in only a little while, i'll cry
'cause you're my lullaby
so baby, come hold me tight 'cause i


i wanna be everything you need
i wanna be where


you're here, your eyes are lookin' into mine
so baby, make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
i'm looking through your $ 
i'm looking through your eyes


just as long as you're mine
i'll be your everything tonight
let me love you, kiss you
oh, baby, let me miss you
let me see your, dream about, dream about
dream about your eyes


ah, ah
beautiful eyes
