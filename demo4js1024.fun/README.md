# [js1024.fun 2020 demo](https://nottgy.github.io/einstain/demo4js1024.fun/demo.html)

It feets in 1024 bytes and also has sound effects in it :-)
But physics are not that great and gameplay could've been better.
You can also visit competitions' [website](https://js1024.fun) and see it there in demos --> 2020
