# [tailwind demo](https://nottgy.github.io/einstain/tailwindcss/1)

This is my first experience with both [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and adaptive web design.
As you can see, this was made through [the scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/tailwind).
I'd highly recommend it to those who want to learn adaptive web design and make pretty websites very quickly.
My demo is not that cool, though. Nothing fancy there, just drilling techniques.
